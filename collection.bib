abstract = {The conversion of data into knowledge constitutes a great challenge for future biological research. The new science of Systems Biology claims to be able to solve the problem but I contend that this approach will fail because deducing models of function from the behaviour of a complex system is an inverse problem that is impossible to solve. In addition, one cannot easily escape into high-level holistic approaches, since the essence of all biological systems is that they are encoded as molecular descriptions in their genes and since genes are molecules and exert their functions through other molecules, the molecular explanation must constitute the core of understanding biological systems. We then solve the forward problem of computing the behaviour of the system from its components and their interactions. I propose that the correct level of abstraction is the cell and provide an outline of CELLMAP, a design for a system to organize biological information.},

abstract = {Endoreplication, also called endoreduplication, is a cell cycle variant of multicellular eukaryotes in which mitosis is skipped and cells repeatedly replicate their DNA, resulting in cellular polyploidy. In recent years, research results have shed light on the molecular mechanism of endoreplication control, but the function of this cell-cycle variant has remained elusive. However, new evidence is at last providing insight into the biological relevance of cellular polyploidy, demonstrating that endoreplication is essential for developmental processes, such as cell fate maintenance, and is a prominent response to physiological conditions, such as pathogen attack or DNA damage. Thus, endoreplication is being revealed as an important module in plant growth that contributes to the robustness of plant life.},

In this review, the origin of the Hox and ParaHox gene clusters by duplication of a ProtoHox gene cluster, and the changes in their gene numbers in major Metazoan Transitions are reviewed critically. Re-evaluation of existing data and recent findings in Cnidarians, Acoels, and critical stages of vertebrate evolution suggest alternative scenarios for the origin, structure, and changes in Hox gene numbers in relevant events of Metazoan evolution. I discuss opposing views and propose that (i) the ProtoHox cluster had only two genes, and not four as commonly believed: a corollary is that the origin of Bilaterians was coincident with the invention of new Hox and ParaHox gene classes, which may have facilitated such a transition; (ii) the ProtoHox cluster duplication was a cis duplication event, rather than a trans duplication event, as previously suggested, and (iii) the ancestral vertebrate cluster possessed 14 Hox genes, and not the 13 generally assumed. These hypotheses could be verified or refuted in the near future, but they may help critical discussion of the evolution of the Hox/ParaHox family in the metazoan kingdom.},

Examples include bifunctional enzymes that carry out two opposing reactions such as phosphorylating and dephosphorylating the same target, regulators that activate and also repress a gene in circuits called incoherent feedforward loops, and cytokines that signal immune cells to both proliferate and die. Such components are termed "paradoxical", and in this review we discuss how they can provide useful features to cell circuits that are otherwise difficult to achieve. In particular, we summarize how paradoxical components can provide robustness, generate temporal pulses, and provide fold-change detection, in which circuits respond to relative rather than absolute changes in signals.},

Here we present a systematic comparative mathematical analysis of the metabolic networks of 43 organisms representing all three domains of life. We show that, despite significant variation in their individual constituents and pathways, these metabolic networks have the same topological scaling properties and show striking similarities to the inherent organization of complex non-biological systems. This may indicate that metabolic organization is not only identical for all living organisms, but also complies with the design principles of robust and error-tolerant scale-free networks, and may represent a common blueprint for the large-scale organization of interactions among all cellular constituents.},

The remarkable developmental plasticity of pluripotent cells is reflected in their unique chromatin marking and organization patterns, or epigenomes. Pluripotent cell epigenomes must organize genetic information in a way that is compatible with both the maintenance of self-renewal programs and the retention of multilineage differentiation potential. In this review, we give a brief overview of the recent technological advances in genomics that are allowing scientists to characterize and compare epigenomes of different cell types at an unprecedented scale and resolution. We then discuss how utilizing these technologies for studies of hESCs has demonstrated that certain chromatin features, including bivalent promoters, poised enhancers, and unique DNA modification patterns, are particularly pervasive in hESCs compared with differentiated cell types. We outline these unique characteristics and discuss the extent to which they are recapitulated in iPSCs. Finally, we envision broad applications of epigenomics in characterizing the quality and differentiation potential of individual pluripotent lines, and we discuss how epigenomic profiling of regulatory elements in hESCs, iPSCs and their derivatives can improve our understanding of complex human diseases and their underlying genetic variants.},

@article{Sharov2013,
abstract = {An extrapolation of the genetic complexity of organisms to earlier times suggests that life began before the Earth was formed. Life may have started from systems with single heritable elements that are functionally equivalent to a nucleotide. The genetic complexity, roughly measured by the number of non-redundant functional nucleotides, is expected to have grown exponentially due to several positive feedback factors: gene cooperation, duplication of genes with their subsequent specialization, and emergence of novel functional niches associated with existing genes. Linear regression of genetic complexity on a log scale extrapolated back to just one base pair suggests the time of the origin of life 9.7 billion years ago. This cosmic time scale for the evolution of life has important consequences: life took ca. 5 billion years to reach the complexity of bacteria; the environments in which life originated and evolved to the prokaryote stage may have been quite different from those envisaged on Earth; there was no intelligent life in our universe prior to the origin of Earth, thus Earth could not have been deliberately seeded with life by intelligent aliens; Earth was seeded by panspermia; experimental replication of the origin of life from scratch may have to emulate many cumulative rare events; and the Drake equation for guesstimating the number of civilizations in the universe is likely wrong, as intelligent life has just begun appearing in our universe. Evolution of advanced organisms has accelerated via development of additional information-processing systems: epigenetic memory, primitive mind, multicellular brain, language, books, computers, and Internet. As a result the doubling time of complexity has reached ca. 20 years. Finally, we discuss the issue of the predicted technological singularity and give a biosemiotics perspective on the increase of complexity.},

abstract = {A major yet unresolved quest in decoding the human genome is the identification of the regulatory sequences that control the spatial and temporal expression of genes. Distant-acting transcriptional enhancers are particularly challenging to uncover because they are scattered among the vast non-coding portion of the genome. Evolutionary sequence constraint can facilitate the discovery of enhancers, but fails to predict when and where they are active in vivo. Here we present the results of chromatin immunoprecipitation with the enhancer-associated protein p300 followed by massively parallel sequencing, and map several thousand in vivo binding sites of p300 in mouse embryonic forebrain, midbrain and limb tissue. We tested 86 of these sequences in a transgenic mouse assay, which in nearly all cases demonstrated reproducible enhancer activity in the tissues that were predicted by p300 binding. Our results indicate that in vivo mapping of p300 binding is a highly accurate means for identifying enhancers and their associated activities, and suggest that such data sets will be useful to study the role of tissue-specific enhancers in human biology and disease on a genome-wide scale.},

abstract = {Oogenesis in the tunicate, Oikopleura, is unusual for a chordate, in that the thousands of nuclei comprising the entire germline are contained in a unique giant cell, the coenocyst. We examined progression through meiotic prophase I in concert with cellular mechanisms implicated in selection, growth and maturation of oocytes in this shared cytoplasm. Unlike sister vertebrates, no germinal vesicle was formed and maternal transcripts were instead synthesized by polyploid nurse nuclei present in equal numbers to transcriptionally quiescent meiotic nuclei. Meiosis resumption was concomitant with MAPK cascade activation during which pERK translocated to nurse nuclei. Simultaneously, the coenocyst partitioned into hundreds of synchronously growing oocytes. Significantly, only the subset of meiotic nuclei selected to populate maturing oocytes displayed histone H3 serine 28 phosphorylation. Disruption of the MAPK cascade, or microtubule dynamics, did not inhibit meiotic resumption but generated oocytes with multiple nurse and meiotic nuclei. As these supernumerary nuclei also became H3S28P enriched, growing oocytes defined a selective kinase environment in the common coenocyst cytoplasm. Vitellogenesis preceded the timing of oocyte selection among excess germ line nuclei in contrast to Drosophila and vertebrates. This unique feature enables late adjustment of oocyte number in accordance with the cytoplasmic volume of the germline cyst accumulated during vitellogenesis.},

This sequence census method was then used to map in vivo binding of the neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRSF; also known as REST, for repressor element-1 silencing transcription factor) to 1946 locations in the human genome. The data display sharp resolution of binding position [+/-50 base pairs (bp)], which facilitated our finding motifs and allowed us to identify noncanonical NRSF-binding motifs. These ChIPSeq data also have high sensitivity and specificity [ROC (receiver operator characteristic) area >/= 0.96] and statistical confidence (P <10(-4)), properties that were important for inferring new candidate interactions. These include key transcription factors in the gene network that regulates pancreatic islet cell development.},

Our hypothesis rests on the central concept that mammalian histone H3 variants (H3.1, H3.2, and H3.3), although remarkably similar in amino acid sequence, exhibit distinct posttranslational "signatures" that create different chromosomal domains or territories, which, in turn, influence epigenetic states during cellular differentiation and development. Although we restrict our comments to H3 variants in mammals, we expect that the more general concepts presented here will apply to other histone variant families in organisms that employ them.},

abstract = {Recent studies of several multigene clusters have shown that gene activation by a remote enhancer is associated with chromatin loop formation. It is not fully understood how a chromatin loop forms in a nucleus or how it is involved in gene regulation. In this article, we propose that the major feature that determines loop formation is the flexibility of chromatin, and that this flexibility is modulated by histone acetylation (and other modifications). Thus, histone modifications will modulate distribution of the preferential looping site in chromatin, which, in turn, determines the probability of interaction between a remote enhancer and the cognate genes. This model can explain gene expression changes in the Hoxd gene cluster and the beta-globin locus.},

abstract = {The Polycomb group (PcG) of repressors and the trithorax group (trxG) of activators maintain the correct expression of several key developmental regulators, including the homeotic genes. PcG and trxG proteins function in distinct multiprotein complexes that are believed to control transcription by changing the structure of chromatin, organizing it into either a 'closed' or an 'open' conformation. The hallmark of gene regulation by PcG/trxG proteins is that it can lead to a mitotically stable pattern of gene expression, often referred to as epigenetic regulation. Although much remains to be learned, recent studies have provided insights into how this epigenetic switch is set, how PcG/trxG proteins might be linked to cis-acting DNA elements and what potential mechanisms underlie stable inheritance of gene expression status over multiple cell divisions. Finally, the study of the evolutionarily conserved PcG/trxG factors has recently gained additional urgency with the realization that they play a pertinent role in certain human cancers.},

We used RNA standards to quantify transcript prevalence and to test the linear range of transcript detection, which spanned five orders of magnitude. Although >90\% of uniquely mapped reads fell within known exons, the remaining data suggest new and revised gene models, including changed or additional promoters, exons and 3' untranscribed regions, as well as new candidate microRNA precursors. RNA splice events, which are not readily measured by standard gene expression microarray or serial analysis of gene expression methods, were detected directly by mapping splice-crossing sequence reads.

abstract = {The T-box gene family was uncovered less than a decade ago but has been recognized as important in controlling many and varied aspects of development in metazoans from hydra to humans. Extensive screening and database searching has revealed several subfamilies of genes with orthologs in species as diverse as Caenorhabditis elegans and humans. The defining feature of the family is a conserved sequence coding for a DNA-binding motif known as the T-box, named after the first-discovered T-box gene, T or Brachyury. Although several T-box proteins have been shown to function as transcriptional regulators, to date only a handful of downstream target genes have been discovered. Similarly, little is known about regulation of the T-box genes themselves. Although not limited to the embryo, expression of T-box genes is characteristically seen in dynamic and highly specific patterns in many tissues and organs during embryogenesis and organogenesis. The essential role of several T-box genes has been demonstrated by the developmental phenotypes of mutant animals.},

In order to understand the ancestral function of Brachyury we cloned NemBra1, a Brachyury homolog from the anthozoan sea anemone Nematostella vectensis. Anthozoa are considered the basal group among the Cnidaria. First NemBra1 expression could be detected at the blastula/gastrula transition and gene activity persists until adulthood of the animals. In situ hybridization shows that NemBra1 expression in gastrulae and early planula larvae is restricted to a circle around the blastopore. When the larvae begin to metamorphose into primary polyps, the expression zone extends into the developing mesenteries. In adult polyps Brachyury expression persists in the mesenteries, but is excluded from the septal filament and the differentiated retractor muscles, which also develop from the mesenteries. We conclude that the ancestral function of Brachyury was in specifying the blastopore and its endodermal derivatives.},

abstract = {ChIP-Seq, which combines chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with ultra high-throughput massively parallel sequencing, is increasingly being used for mapping protein-DNA interactions in-vivo on a genome scale. Typically, short sequence reads from ChIP-Seq are mapped to a reference genome for further analysis. Although genomic regions enriched with mapped reads could be inferred as approximate binding regions, short read lengths (approximately 25-50 nt) pose challenges for determining the exact binding sites within these regions. Here, we present SISSRs (Site Identification from Short Sequence Reads), a novel algorithm for precise identification of binding sites from short reads generated from ChIP-Seq experiments. The sensitivity and specificity of SISSRs are demonstrated by applying it on ChIP-Seq data for three widely studied and well-characterized human transcription factors: CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor), NRSF (neuron-restrictive silencer factor) and STAT1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription protein 1). We identified 26 814, 5813 and 73 956 binding sites for CTCF, NRSF and STAT1 proteins, respectively, which is 32, 299 and 78\% more than that inferred previously for the respective proteins. Motif analysis revealed that an overwhelming majority of the identified binding sites contained the previously established consensus binding sequence for the respective proteins, thus attesting for SISSRs' accuracy. SISSRs' sensitivity and precision facilitated further analyses of ChIP-Seq data revealing interesting insights, which we believe will serve as guidance for designing ChIP-Seq experiments to map in vivo protein-DNA interactions. We also show that tag densities at the binding sites are a good indicator of protein-DNA binding affinity, which could be used to distinguish and characterize strong and weak binding sites. Using tag density as an indicator of DNA-binding affinity, we have identified core residues within the NRSF and CTCF binding sites that are critical for a stronger DNA binding.},

abstract = {Cellular differentiation entails loss of pluripotency and gain of lineage- and cell-type-specific characteristics. Using a murine system that progresses from stem cells to lineage-committed progenitors to terminally differentiated neurons, we analyzed DNA methylation and Polycomb-mediated histone H3 methylation (H3K27me3). We show that several hundred promoters, including pluripotency and germline-specific genes, become DNA methylated in lineage-committed progenitor cells, suggesting that DNA methylation may already repress pluripotency in progenitor cells. Conversely, we detect loss and acquisition of H3K27me3 at additional targets in both progenitor and terminal states. Surprisingly, many neuron-specific genes that become activated upon terminal differentiation are Polycomb targets only in progenitor cells. Moreover, promoters marked by H3K27me3 in stem cells frequently become DNA methylated during differentiation, suggesting context-dependent crosstalk between Polycomb and DNA methylation. These data suggest a model how de novo DNA methylation and dynamic switches in Polycomb targets restrict pluripotency and define the developmental potential of progenitor cells.},

abstract = {Mammals use DNA methylation for the heritable silencing of retrotransposons and imprinted genes and for the inactivation of the X chromosome in females. The establishment of patterns of DNA methylation during gametogenesis depends in part on DNMT3L, an enzymatically inactive regulatory factor that is related in sequence to the DNA methyltransferases DNMT3A and DNMT3B. The main proteins that interact in vivo with the product of an epitope-tagged allele of the endogenous Dnmt3L gene were identified by mass spectrometry as DNMT3A2, DNMT3B and the four core histones. Peptide interaction assays showed that DNMT3L specifically interacts with the extreme amino terminus of histone H3; this interaction was strongly inhibited by methylation at lysine 4 of histone H3 but was insensitive to modifications at other positions. Crystallographic studies of human DNMT3L showed that the protein has a carboxy-terminal methyltransferase-like domain and an N-terminal cysteine-rich domain. Cocrystallization of DNMT3L with the tail of histone H3 revealed that the tail bound to the cysteine-rich domain of DNMT3L, and substitution of key residues in the binding site eliminated the H3 tail-DNMT3L interaction. These data indicate that DNMT3L recognizes histone H3 tails that are unmethylated at lysine 4 and induces de novo DNA methylation by recruitment or activation of DNMT3A2.},

abstract = {The evolutionary origin of the anterior-posterior and the dorsoventral body axes of Bilateria is a long-standing question. It is unclear how the main body axis of Cnidaria, the sister group to the Bilateria, is related to the two body axes of Bilateria. The conserved antagonism between two secreted factors, BMP2/4 (Dpp in Drosophila) and its antagonist Chordin (Short gastrulation in Drosophila) is a crucial component in the establishment of the dorsoventral body axis of Bilateria and could therefore provide important insight into the evolutionary origin of bilaterian axes. Here, we cloned and characterized two BMP ligands, dpp and GDF5-like as well as two secreted antagonists, chordin and gremlin, from the basal cnidarian Nematostella vectensis. Injection experiments in zebrafish show that the ventralizing activity of NvDpp mRNA is counteracted by NvGremlin and NvChordin, suggesting that Gremlin and Chordin proteins can function as endogenous antagonists of NvDpp. Expression analysis during embryonic and larval development of Nematostella reveals asymmetric expression of all four genes along both the oral-aboral body axis and along an axis perpendicular to this one, the directive axis. Unexpectedly, NvDpp and NvChordin show complex and overlapping expression on the same side of the embryo, whereas NvGDF5-like and NvGremlin are both expressed on the opposite side. Yet, the two pairs of ligands and antagonists only partially overlap, suggesting complex gradients of BMP activity along the directive axis but also along the oral-aboral axis. We conclude that a molecular interaction between BMP-like molecules and their secreted antagonists was already employed in the common ancestor of Cnidaria and Bilateria to create axial asymmetries, but that there is no simple relationship between the oral-aboral body axis of Nematostella and one particular body axis of Bilateria.},

The growing popularity of ChIP-seq spurred the development of many different analytical programs (at last count, we noted 31 open source methods), each with some purported advantage. Given that the literature is dense and empirical benchmarking challenging, selecting an appropriate method for ChIP-seq analysis has become a daunting task. Herein we compare the performance of eleven different peak calling programs on common empirical, transcription factor datasets and measure their sensitivity, accuracy and usability.

abstract = {Dramatic progress in the development of next-generation sequencing technologies has enabled accurate genome-wide characterization of the binding sites of DNA-associated proteins. This technique, baptized as ChIP-Seq, uses a combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation and massively parallel DNA sequencing. Other published tools that predict binding sites from ChIP-Seq data use only positional information of mapped reads. In contrast, our algorithm MICSA (Motif Identification for ChIP-Seq Analysis) combines this source of positional information with information on motif occurrences to better predict binding sites of transcription factors (TFs). We proved the greater accuracy of MICSA with respect to several other tools by running them on datasets for the TFs NRSF, GABP, STAT1 and CTCF. We also applied MICSA on a dataset for the oncogenic TF EWS-FLI1. We discovered >2000 binding sites and two functionally different binding motifs. We observed that EWS-FLI1 can activate gene transcription when (i) its binding site is located in close proximity to the gene transcription start site (up to approximately 150 kb), and (ii) it contains a microsatellite sequence. Furthermore, we observed that sites without microsatellites can also induce regulation of gene expression--positively as often as negatively--and at much larger distances (up to approximately 1 Mb).},

abstract = {Histones comprise the major protein component of chromatin, the scaffold in which the eukaryotic genome is packaged, and are subject to many types of post-translational modifications (PTMs), especially on their flexible tails. These modifications may constitute a 'histone code' and could be used to manage epigenetic information that helps extend the genetic message beyond DNA sequences. This proposed code, read in part by histone PTM-binding 'effector' modules and their associated complexes, is predicted to define unique functional states of chromatin and/or regulate various chromatin-templated processes. A wealth of structural and functional data show how chromatin effector modules target their cognate covalent histone modifications. Here we summarize key features in molecular recognition of histone PTMs by a diverse family of 'reader pockets', highlighting specific readout mechanisms for individual marks, common themes and insights into the downstream functional consequences of the interactions. Changes in these interactions may have far-reaching implications for human biology and disease, notably cancer.},

abstract = {The generation of distinctive cell types that form different tissues and organs requires precise, temporal and spatial control of gene expression. This depends on specific cis-regulatory elements distributed in the noncoding DNA surrounding their target genes. Studies performed on mammalian embryonic stem cells and Drosophila embryos suggest that active enhancers form part of a defined chromatin landscape marked by histone H3 lysine 4 mono-methylation (H3K4me1) and histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac). Nevertheless, little is known about the dynamics and the potential roles of these marks during vertebrate embryogenesis. Here, we provide genomic maps of H3K4me1/me3 and H3K27ac at four developmental time-points of zebrafish embryogenesis and analyze embryonic enhancer activity. We find that (1) changes in H3K27ac enrichment at enhancers accompany the shift from pluripotency to tissue-specific gene expression, (2) in early embryos, the peaks of H3K27ac enrichment are bound by pluripotent factors such as Nanog, and (3) the degree of evolutionary conservation is higher for enhancers that become marked by H3K27ac at the end of gastrulation, suggesting their implication in the establishment of the most conserved (phylotypic) transcriptome that is known to occur later at the pharyngula stage.},

abstract = {Modulation of VEGFR-3 expression is important for altering lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC) characteristics during the lymphangiogenic processes that occur under developmental, physiological, and pathological conditions. However, the mechanisms underlying the modulation of Vegfr3 gene expression remain largely unknown. Using genetically engineered mice and LECs, we demonstrated previously that Ras signaling is involved not only in VEGFR-3-induced signal transduction but also in Vegfr3 gene expression. Here, we investigated the roles of the transcription factor Ets and the histone acetyltransferase p300 in LECs in Ras-mediated transcriptional regulation of Vegfr3. Ras activates Ets proteins via MAPK-induced phosphorylation. Ets knockdown, similar to Ras knockdown, resulted in a decrease in both Vegfr3 transcript levels and acetylated histone H3 on the Vegfr3 gene. Vegfr3 knockdown results in altered LEC phenotypes, such as aberrant cell proliferation and network formation, and Ets knockdown led to milder but similar phenotypic changes. We identified evolutionarily conserved, non-coding regulatory elements within the Vegfr3 gene that harbor Ets-binding motifs and have enhancer activities in LECs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays revealed that acetylated histone H3 on the regulatory elements of the Vegfr3 gene was decreased following Ras and Ets knockdown, and that activated Ets proteins, together with p300, were associated with these regulatory elements, consistent with a reduction in Vegfr3 gene expression in p300-knockdown LECs. Our findings demonstrate a link between Ras signaling and Ets- and p300-mediated transcriptional regulation of Vegfr3, and provide a potential mechanism by which VEGFR-3 expression levels may be modulated during lymphangiogenesis.},

abstract = {Transcriptional on and off states of HOX genes and other developmental control genes are maintained by antagonistic regulators encoded by trithorax group (trxG) and Polycomb group (PcG) genes. The trxG proteins Ash1 and hTRX and the PcG repressor E(z) are histone methyltransferases (HMTases) that methylate distinct lysine residues in the N-terminal tail of histone H3. trxG proteins are generally thought to function as activators of HOX genes, but how histone methylation by Ash1 and Trx promotes HOX gene transcription is not clear. Here, we show that in ash1 and trx mutants expression of HOX genes is lost within their normal expression domains, but we find that, contrary to expectation, this expression is restored in ash1 and trx mutants that also lack PcG gene function. Moreover, such trxG PcG double mutants show severe misexpression of HOX genes and, hence, ectopic activation of HOX genes caused by the removal of PcG gene function also occurs in the absence of ash1 and trx function. Together, these results suggest that the Ash1 and Trx HMTases are not "coactivators" required for transcriptional activation of HOX genes, but function specifically as anti-repressors. We propose that histone methylation by Ash1 and Trx is required continuously throughout development to prevent inappropriate PcG silencing of HOX genes in cells in which they must stay transcriptionally active.},

abstract = {Post-genomic data show unexpected extent of the transcribed genome and the size of individual primary transcripts. Hence, most cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) binding transcription factors (TFs) at promotor, enhancer and other sites are actually transcribed within full domain transcripts (FDTs). The ensemble of these CRMs placed way upstream of exon clusters, downstream and in intronic or intergenic positions represent a program of gene expression which has been formally analysed within the Gene and Genon concept [1,2]. This concept has emphasised the necessity to separate product information from regulative information to allow information-theoretic analysis of gene expression. Classically, TFs have been assumed to act at DNA level exclusively but evidence has accumulated indicating eventual post-transcriptional functions. The transcription factor cycle (TFC) hypothesis suggests the transfer of DNA-bound factors to nascent RNA. Exerting downstream functions in RNA processing and transport, these factors would be liberated by RNA processing and cycle back to the DNA maintaining active transcription. Sequestered on RNA in absence of processing they would constitute a negative feedback loop. The TFC concept may explain epigenetic regulation in mitosis and meiosis. In mitosis control factors may survive as single proteins but also attached to FDTs as organised complexes. This process might perpetuate in cell division conditioning of chromatin for transcription. As observed on lampbrush chromosomes formed in avian and amphibian oogenesis, in meiosis the genome is fully transcribed and oocytes conserve high Mr RNA of high sequence complexity. When new interphase chromosomes form in daughter cells and early embryogenesis, TFs and other factors attached to RNA might be reinserted onto the DNA.},

This information can be interrogated to study various aspects of TF behaviour, including the mechanisms that control TF binding. Physical interaction between TFs comprises one important aspect of TF binding in eukaryotes, mediating tissue-specific gene expression. We have developed an algorithm, spaced motif analysis (SpaMo), which is able to infer physical interactions between the given TF and TFs bound at neighbouring sites at the DNA interface. The algorithm predicts TF interactions in half of the ChIP-seq data sets we test, with the majority of these predictions supported by direct evidence from the literature or evidence of homodimerization. High resolution motif spacing information obtained by this method can facilitate an improved understanding of individual TF complex structures. SpaMo can assist researchers in extracting maximum information relating to binding mechanisms from their TF ChIP-seq data. SpaMo is available for download and interactive use as part of the MEME Suite (http://meme.nbcr.net).},

We conducted an in vivo mass-spectrometry study of the phosphoproteomes of three yeast species (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida albicans, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe) in order to quantify the evolutionary rate of change of phosphorylation. We estimate that kinase-substrate interactions change, at most, two orders of magnitude more slowly than transcription factor (TF)-promoter interactions. Our computational analysis linking kinases to putative substrates recapitulates known phosphoregulation events and provides putative evolutionary histories for the kinase regulation of protein complexes across 11 yeast species. To validate these trends, we used the E-MAP approach to analyze over 2,000 quantitative genetic interactions in S. cerevisiae and Sc. pombe, which demonstrated that protein kinases, and to a greater extent TFs, show lower than average conservation of genetic interactions. We propose therefore that protein kinases are an important source of phenotypic diversity.},

abstract = {An important technology in model organisms is the ability to make transgenic animals. In the past, transgenic technology in zebrafish has been limited by the relatively low efficiency with which transgenes could be generated using either DNA microinjection or retroviral infection. Previous efforts to generate transgenic zebrafish with retroviral vectors used a pseudotyped virus with a genome based on the Moloney murine leukemia virus and the envelope protein of the vesicular stomatitis virus. This virus was injected into blastula-stage zebrafish, and 16\% of the injected embryos transmitted proviral insertions to their offspring, with most founders transmitting a single insertion to approximately 2\% of their progeny. In an effort to improve this transgenic frequency, we have generated pseudotyped viral stocks of two new Moloney-based genomes. These viral stocks have titers up to two orders of magnitude higher than that used previously. Injection of these viruses resulted in a dramatic increase in transgenic efficiency; over three different experiments, 83\% (110/133) of the injected embryos transmitted proviral insertions to 24\% of their offspring. Furthermore, founders made with one of the viruses transmitted an average of 11 different insertions through their germ line. These results represent a 50- to 100-fold improvement in the efficiency of generating transgenic zebrafish, making it now feasible for a single lab to rapidly generate tens to hundreds of thousands of transgenes. Consequently, large-scale insertional mutagenesis strategies, previously limited to invertebrates, may now be possible in a vertebrate.},

Previously, we have developed a transient embryonic excision assay in zebrafish, in which zebrafish embryos were injected with a plasmid DNA harboring the Tol2 element, and have shown that the Tol2 element is excisable from the injected plasmid DNA (Kawakami, K., Koga, A., Hori, H., Shima, A., 1998. Excision of the Tol2 transposable element of the medaka fish, Oryzias latipes, in zebrafish, Danio rerio. Gene 225, 17-22). Although the Tol2 element is thought to be autonomous, an active transposase encoded by the Tol2 element has not been identified. Here we report the identification and analysis of mRNA transcribed from the Tol2 element in zebrafish embryos. The Tol2 transcript has the capacity to encode a protein of 649 amino acids, whose amino acid sequence is similar to those of transposases of the hAT family. To determine whether the transcript encodes an active enzyme, we developed a novel transient embryonic excision assay in which zebrafish fertilized eggs were co-injected with RNA transcribed in vitro using the Tol2 cDNA as a template and a plasmid DNA harboring a nonautonomous Tol2 element, which has a deletion in the transposase coding region. The nonautonomous Tol2 element could be efficiently excised in the zebrafish only when co-injected with the Tol2 RNA. This result indicates that the Tol2 transcript encodes an active enzyme, a probable transposase, that can catalyze the excision reaction in trans. Further, by the co-injection analysis, we found that the Tol2 sequence lacking the first intron sequence of the transposase gene could not be excised, suggesting that it may contain essential cis-elements.},

abstract = {The Tol2 element of the medaka fish Oryzias latipes belongs to the hAT family of transposons (hobo/Ac/Tam3). We report here identification of a functional transposase of Tol2 that is capable of catalyzing its transposition in the germ line of zebrafish Danio rerio. A transcript produced from Tol2 encodes a putative transposase. Zebrafish fertilized eggs were coinjected with mRNA transcribed in vitro, using cDNA of the Tol2 transcript as a template and a plasmid DNA harboring a mutant Tol2, which had a deletion in the putative transposase gene but retained necessary cis sequences. The injected fish were raised to adulthood and mated to noninjected fish, and genomic DNA of the progeny fish were analyzed by PCR and Southern hybridization. Half of F(1) fish obtained from one of eight injected fish contained the Tol2 DNA in their genomes but not the vector portion. Among these F(1) fish, Tol2 insertions at four different loci were identified, and some F(1) fish carried two or three different Tol2 insertions, indicating that the germ line of the founder fish is highly mosaic. Sequencing analyses revealed that, in all cases, Tol2 was surrounded by zebrafish genomic sequences, and an 8-bp duplication was created at the target site, indicating that Tol2 was integrated in the zebrafish genome through transposition. This study identifies an autonomous member of a DNA-based transposable element from a vertebrate genome. The Tol2 transposon system should thus be used to develop novel transgenesis and insertional mutagenesis methods in zebrafish and possibly in other fishes.},

abstract = {The medaka fish Tol2 element is an autonomous transposon that encodes a fully functional transposase. The transposase protein can catalyze transposition of a transposon construct that has 200 and 150 base pairs of DNA from the left and right ends of the Tol2 sequence, respectively. These sequences contain essential terminal inverted repeats and subterminal sequences. DNA inserts of fairly large sizes (as large as 11 kilobases) can be cloned between these sequences without reducing transpositional activity. The Tol2 transposon system has been shown to be active in all vertebrate cells tested thus far, including zebrafish, Xenopus, chicken, mouse, and human. In this review I describe and discuss how the Tol2 transposon is being applied to transgenic studies in these vertebrates, and possible future applications.},

First, we established a highly efficient transgenesis method in which a plasmid DNA containing the Tol2 transposon vector and the transposase mRNA synthesized in vitro were coinjected into one-cell stage embryos. The transposon vector inserted in the genome could be transmitted to the F1 progeny at high frequencies, and regulated gene expression by a specific promoter could be recapitulated in transgenic fish. Then we constructed a transposon-based gene trap vector containing a splice acceptor and the GFP gene, performed a pilot screen for gene trapping, and obtained fish expressing GFP in temporally and spatially restricted patterns. We confirmed the endogenous transcripts were indeed trapped by the insertions, and the insertion could interfere with expression of the trapped gene. We propose our gene trap approach should facilitate studies of vertebrate development and organogenesis.},

abstract = {Transgenesis is an important methodology for studying the function of genes and genomes in model plants and animals. For the model vertebrate zebrafish, methods using the Tol2 transposable element have been developed for this purpose. With these methods, the function of the transgene can be analyzed in both transient and stable transgenic fish. Recently, cis-sequences necessary for transposition of the Tol2 element were revealed. This enabled development of transposon vectors containing minimal DNA sequences that are easily manipulated. More recently, several transposon vectors containing the Gateway sequence were created and reported. These are useful because any foreign sequences can be cloned into a transposon vector fairly easily and rapidly. This chapter describes the features of these transposon vectors, and protocols to perform transgenesis in zebrafish.},

abstract = {The zebrafish is rapidly becoming a popular model system for the study of vertebrate development because it is ideal for both embryological studies and genetic analysis. To determine if a retroviral vector pseudotyped with the envelope glycoprotein of the vesicular stomatitis virus could infect zebrafish embryos, and in particular, the cells destined to become the germ line, a pseudotyped virus was injected into blastula-stage zebrafish embryos. Fifty-one embryos were allowed to develop and eight transmitted proviral DNA to their progeny. Founders were mosaic, but as expected, transgenic F1's transmitted proviral DNA in a Mendelian fashion to the F2 progeny. Transgenic F1 fish inherited a single integrated provirus, and a single founder could transmit more than one viral integration to its progeny. These results demonstrate that this pantropic pseudotyped vector, originally developed for human gene therapy, will make the use of retroviral vectors in zebrafish possible.},

abstract = {We have used the Tol2 transposable element to design and perform effective enhancer trapping in zebrafish. Modified transposon DNA and transposase RNA were delivered into zebrafish embryos by microinjection to produce heritable insertions in the zebrafish genome. The enhancer trap construct carries the EGFP gene controlled by a partial epithelial promoter from the keratin8 gene. Enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) is used as a marker to select F1 transgenic fish and as a reporter to trap enhancers. We have isolated 28 transgenic lines that were derived from the 37 GFP-positive F0 founders and displayed various specific EGFP expression patterns in addition to basal expression from the modified keratin 8 promoter. Analyses of expression by whole-mount RNA in situ hybridization demonstrated that these patterns could recapitulate the expression of the tagged genes to a variable extent and, therefore, confirmed that our construct worked effectively as an enhancer trap. Transgenic offspring from the 37 F0 EGFP-positive founders have been genetically analyzed up to the F2 generation. Flanking sequences from 65 separate transposon insertion sites were identified by thermal asymmetric interlaced polymerase chain reaction. Injection of the transposase RNA into transgenic embryos induced remobilization of genomic Tol2 copies producing novel insertions including some in the germ line. The approach has great potential for developmental and anatomical studies of teleosts.},

abstract = {The nuclear arrangement of the ABL, c-MYC, and RB1 genes was quantitatively investigated in human undifferentiated HL-60 cells and in a terminally differentiated population of human granulocytes. The ABL gene was expressed in both cell types, the c-MYC gene was active in HL-60 cells and down-regulated in granulocytes, and expression of the RB1 gene was undetectable in HL-60 cells but up-regulated in granulocytes. The distances of these genes to the nuclear center (membrane), to the center of the corresponding chromosome territory, and to the nearest centromere were determined. During granulopoesis, the majority of selected genetic structures were repositioned closer to the nuclear periphery. The nuclear reposition of the genes studied did not correlate with the changes of their expression. In both cell types, the c-MYC and RB1 genes were located at the periphery of the chromosome territories regardless of their activity. The centromeres of chromosomes 8 and 13 were always positioned more centrally within the chromosome territory than the studied genes. Close spatial proximity of the c-MYC and RB1 genes with centromeric heterochromatin, forming the chromocenters, correlated with gene activity, although the nearest chromocenter of the silenced RB1 gene did not involve centromeric heterochromatin of chromosome 13 where the given gene is localized. In addition, the role of heterochromatin in gene silencing was studied in retinoblastoma cells. In these differentiated tumor cells, one copy of the RB1 gene was positioned near the heterochromatic chromosome X, and reduced RB1 gene activity was observed. In the experiments presented here, we provide evidence that the regulation of gene activity during important cellular processes such as differentiation or carcinogenesis may be realized through heterochromatin-mediated gene silencing.},

@article{Beshiri2010,
abstract = {Recruitment of transcriptional and epigenetic factors to their targets is a key step in their regulation. Prominently featured in recruitment are the protein domains that bind to specific histone modifications. One such domain is the plant homeodomain (PHD), found in several chromatin-binding proteins. The epigenetic factor RBP2 has multiple PHD domains, however, they have different functions (Figure 4). In particular, the C-terminal PHD domain, found in a RBP2 oncogenic fusion in human leukemia, binds to trimethylated lysine 4 in histone H3 (H3K4me3). The transcript corresponding to the RBP2 isoform containing the C-terminal PHD accumulates during differentiation of promonocytic, lymphoma-derived, U937 cells into monocytes. Consistent with both sets of data, genome-wide analysis showed that in differentiated U937 cells, the RBP2 protein gets localized to genomic regions highly enriched for H3K4me3. Localization of RBP2 to its targets correlates with a decrease in H3K4me3 due to RBP2 histone demethylase activity and a decrease in transcriptional activity. In contrast, two other PHDs of RBP2 are unable to bind H3K4me3. Notably, the C-terminal domain PHD of RBP2 is absent in the smaller RBP2 isoform. It is conceivable that the small isoform of RBP2, which lacks interaction with H3K4me3, differs from the larger isoform in genomic location. The difference in genomic location of RBP2 isoforms may account for the observed diversity in RBP2 function. Specifically, RBP2 is a critical player in cellular differentiation mediated by the retinoblastoma protein (pRB). Consistent with these data, previous genome-wide analysis, without distinction between isoforms, identified two distinct groups of RBP2 target genes: 1) genes bound by RBP2 in a manner that is independent of differentiation; 2) genes bound by RBP2 in a differentiation-dependent manner. To identify differences in localization between the isoforms we performed genome-wide location analysis by ChIP-Seq. Using antibodies that detect both RBP2 isoforms we have located all RBP2 targets. Additionally we have antibodies that only bind large, and not small RBP2 isoform (Figure 4). After identifying the large isoform targets, one can then subtract them from all RBP2 targets to reveal the targets of small isoform. These data show the contribution of chromatin-interacting domain in protein recruitment to its binding sites in the genome.},

The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project has systematically mapped regions of transcription, transcription factor association, chromatin structure and histone modification. These data enabled us to assign biochemical functions for 80\% of the genome, in particular outside of the well-studied protein-coding regions. Many discovered candidate regulatory elements are physically associated with one another and with expressed genes, providing new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation. The newly identified elements also show a statistical correspondence to sequence variants linked to human disease, and can thereby guide interpretation of this variation. Overall, the project provides new insights into the organization and regulation of our genes and genome, and is an expansive resource of functional annotations for biomedical research.},

abstract = {Cells of a multicellular organism are genetically homogeneous but structurally and functionally heterogeneous owing to the differential expression of genes. Many of these differences in gene expression arise during development and are subsequently retained through mitosis. Stable alterations of this kind are said to be 'epigenetic', because they are heritable in the short term but do not involve mutations of the DNA itself. Research over the past few years has focused on two molecular mechanisms that mediate epigenetic phenomena: DNA methylation and histone modifications. Here, we review advances in the understanding of the mechanism and role of DNA methylation in biological processes. Epigenetic effects by means of DNA methylation have an important role in development but can also arise stochastically as animals age. Identification of proteins that mediate these effects has provided insight into this complex process and diseases that occur when it is perturbed. External influences on epigenetic processes are seen in the effects of diet on long-term diseases such as cancer. Thus, epigenetic mechanisms seem to allow an organism to respond to the environment through changes in gene expression. The extent to which environmental effects can provoke epigenetic responses represents an exciting area of future research.},

abstract = {Two-thirds of gene promoters in mammals are associated with regions of non-methylated DNA, called CpG islands (CGIs), which counteract the repressive effects of DNA methylation on chromatin. In cold-blooded vertebrates, computational CGI predictions often reside away from gene promoters, suggesting a major divergence in gene promoter architecture across vertebrates. By experimentally identifying non-methylated DNA in the genomes of seven diverse vertebrates, we instead reveal that non-methylated islands (NMIs) of DNA are a central feature of vertebrate gene promoters. Furthermore, NMIs are present at orthologous genes across vast evolutionary distances, revealing a surprising level of conservation in this epigenetic feature. By profiling NMIs in different tissues and developmental stages we uncover a unifying set of features that are central to the function of NMIs in vertebrates. Together these findings demonstrate an ancient logic for NMI usage at gene promoters and reveal an unprecedented level of epigenetic conservation across vertebrate evolution. http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00348.001.},

abstract = {A 2.91-billion base pair (bp) consensus sequence of the euchromatic portion of the human genome was generated by the whole-genome shotgun sequencing method. The 14.8-billion bp DNA sequence was generated over 9 months from 27,271,853 high-quality sequence reads (5.11-fold coverage of the genome) from both ends of plasmid clones made from the DNA of five individuals. Two assembly strategies-a whole-genome assembly and a regional chromosome assembly-were used, each combining sequence data from Celera and the publicly funded genome effort. The public data were shredded into 550-bp segments to create a 2.9-fold coverage of those genome regions that had been sequenced, without including biases inherent in the cloning and assembly procedure used by the publicly funded group. This brought the effective coverage in the assemblies to eightfold, reducing the number and size of gaps in the final assembly over what would be obtained with 5.11-fold coverage. The two assembly strategies yielded very similar results that largely agree with independent mapping data. The assemblies effectively cover the euchromatic regions of the human chromosomes. More than 90\% of the genome is in scaffold assemblies of 100,000 bp or more, and 25\% of the genome is in scaffolds of 10 million bp or larger. Analysis of the genome sequence revealed 26,588 protein-encoding transcripts for which there was strong corroborating evidence and an additional approximately 12,000 computationally derived genes with mouse matches or other weak supporting evidence. Although gene-dense clusters are obvious, almost half the genes are dispersed in low G+C sequence separated by large tracts of apparently noncoding sequence. Only 1.1\% of the genome is spanned by exons, whereas 24\% is in introns, with 75\% of the genome being intergenic DNA. Duplications of segmental blocks, ranging in size up to chromosomal lengths, are abundant throughout the genome and reveal a complex evolutionary history. Comparative genomic analysis indicates vertebrate expansions of genes associated with neuronal function, with tissue-specific developmental regulation, and with the hemostasis and immune systems. DNA sequence comparisons between the consensus sequence and publicly funded genome data provided locations of 2.1 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A random pair of human haploid genomes differed at a rate of 1 bp per 1250 on average, but there was marked heterogeneity in the level of polymorphism across the genome. Less than 1\% of all SNPs resulted in variation in proteins, but the task of determining which SNPs have functional consequences remains an open challenge.},

abstract = {In a restricted group of opportunistic fungal pathogens the universal leucine CUG codon is translated both as serine (97\%) and leucine (3\%), challenging the concept that translational ambiguity has a negative impact in living organisms. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the in vivo tolerance to a nonconserved genetic code alteration, we have undertaken an extensive structural analysis of proteins containing CUG-encoded residues and solved the crystal structures of the two natural isoforms of Candida albicans seryl-tRNA synthetase. We show that codon reassignment resulted in a nonrandom genome-wide CUG redistribution tailored to minimize protein misfolding events induced by the large-scale leucine-to-serine replacement within the CTG clade. Leucine or serine incorporation at the CUG position in C. albicans seryl-tRNA synthetase induces only local structural changes and, although both isoforms display tRNA serylation activity, the leucine-containing isoform is more active. Similarly, codon ambiguity is predicted to shape the function of C. albicans proteins containing CUG-encoded residues in functionally relevant positions, some of which have a key role in signaling cascades associated with morphological changes and pathogenesis. This study provides a first detailed analysis on natural reassignment of codon identity, unveiling a highly dynamic evolutionary pattern of thousands of fungal CUG codons to confer an optimized balance between protein structural robustness and functional plasticity.},

abstract = {Transcriptional silencing in Saccharomyces cerevisiae at the HM mating-type loci and telomeres occurs through the formation of a heterochromatin-like structure. HM silencing is regulated by cis-acting elements, termed silencers, and by trans-acting factors that bind to the silencers. These factors attract the four SIR (silent information regulator) proteins, three of which (SIR2-4) spread from the silencers to alter chromatin, hence silencing nearby genes. We show here that an HMR locus with a defective silencer can be silenced by anchoring the locus to the nuclear periphery. This was accomplished by fusing integral membrane proteins to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain and overproducing the hybrid proteins, causing them to accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum and the nuclear membrane. We expressed the hybrid proteins in a strain carrying an HMR silencer with GAL4-binding sites (UAS(G)) replacing silencer elements, causing the silencer to become anchored to the nuclear periphery and leading to silencing of a nearby reporter gene. This silencing required the hybrids of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain with membrane proteins, the UAS(G) sites and the SIR proteins. Our results indicate that perinuclear localization helps to establish transcriptionally silent chromatin.},

abstract = {Proliferative and endoreduplicative cell cycles are used to variable extents during the ontogeny of individual organisms and in different evolutionary lineages. Chordate growth and development is typically dominated by proliferative cycles, but the urochordate, Oikopleura dioica, has systemically elaborated a number of endocycling modes to support rapid development and growth in an extraordinarily short chordate life cycle. Here, we identify the O. dioica cyclin and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complements and assess their deployment with respect to mitotic, meiotic, and endoreduplicative life cycle phases. Oikopleura dioica's "transcriptional" cyclin and CDK complements are similar to other complex invertebrates, whereas both the "cell cycle" cyclin and CDK complements display astonishing amplifications centered on the cyclin D, cyclin B, and CDK1 families. Somatic endocycles in O. dioica involve downregulation of cyclins B and A, as in other endocycle model systems, but are also characterized by overlapping expression of an array of cyclin D isoforms. Amplification of the mitotic CDK1 family to five paralogs, which continue to be expressed in endocycling phases, is unexpected as suppression of CDK1 activity is central to endocycle transitions in Drosophila and mammals. This amplification is unique among metazoans, and substitutions in odCDK1 paralogs in the nearly invariant cyclin interaction PSTAIRE helix show striking parallels to those in the only other known eukaryotic CDK1 paralogs, plant CDKA and CDKB. As plant CDK1 paralogs exhibit an expanded repertoire of cyclin partners, including cyclin D, the evolutionary coexpansion of odCDK1 and odCyclin D families suggests that multiple CDK1-cyclin D complexes may modulate spatiotemporal control of kinase activity and substrate specificity in diverse cell cycle variants.},

abstract = {Much of our knowledge about mammalian evolution comes from examination of dental fossils, because the highly calcified enamel that covers teeth causes them to be among the best-preserved organs. As mammals entered new ecological niches, many changes in tooth number occurred, presumably as adaptations to new diets. For example, in contrast to humans, who have two incisors in each dental quadrant, rodents only have one incisor per quadrant. The rodent incisor, because of its unusual morphogenesis and remarkable stem cell-based continuous growth, presents a quandary for evolutionary biologists, as its origin in the fossil record is difficult to trace, and the genetic regulation of incisor number remains a largely open question. Here, we studied a series of mice carrying mutations in sprouty genes, the protein products of which are antagonists of receptor-tyrosine kinase signaling. In sprouty loss-of-function mutants, splitting of gene expression domains and reduced apoptosis was associated with subdivision of the incisor primordium and a multiplication of its stem cell-containing regions. Interestingly, changes in sprouty gene dosage led to a graded change in incisor number, with progressive decreases in sprouty dosage leading to increasing numbers of teeth. Moreover, the independent development of two incisors in mutants with large decreases in sprouty dosage mimicked the likely condition of rodent ancestors. Together, our findings indicate that altering genetic dosage of an antagonist can recapitulate ancestral dental characters, and that tooth number can be progressively regulated by changing levels of activity of a single signal transduction pathway.},

abstract = {A quantitative comparison of higher-order chromatin arrangements was performed in human cell types with three-dimensionally (3D) preserved, differently shaped nuclei. These cell types included flat-ellipsoid nuclei of diploid amniotic fluid cells and fibroblasts and spherical nuclei of B and T lymphocytes from peripheral human blood. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) was performed with chromosome paint probes for large (\#1-5) and small (\#17-20) autosomes, and for the two sex chromosomes. Other probes delineated heterochromatin blocks of numerous larger and smaller human chromosomes. Shape differences correlated with distinct differences in higher order chromatin arrangements: in the spherically shaped lymphocyte nuclei we noted the preferential positioning of the small, gene dense \#17, 19 and 20 chromosome territories (CTs) in the 3D nuclear interior--typically without any apparent connection to the nuclear envelope. In contrast, CTs of the gene-poor small chromosomes \#18 and Y were apparently attached at the nuclear envelope. CTs of large chromosomes were also preferentially located towards the nuclear periphery. In the ellipsoid nuclei of amniotic fluid cells and fibroblasts, all tested CTs showed attachments to the upper and/or lower part of the nuclear envelope: CTs of small chromosomes, including \#18 and Y, were located towards the centre of the nuclear projection (CNP), while the large chromosomes were positioned towards the 2D nuclear rim. In contrast to these highly reproducible radial arrangements, 2D distances measured between heterochromatin blocks of homologous and heterologous CTs were strikingly variable. These results as well as CT painting let us conclude that nuclear functions in the studied cell types may not require reproducible side-by-side arrangements of specific homologous or non-homologous CTs. 3D-modelling of statistical arrangements of 46 human CTs in spherical nuclei was performed under the assumption of a linear correlation between DNA content of each chromosome and its CT volume. In a set of modelled nuclei, we noted the preferential localization of smaller CTs towards the 3D periphery and of larger CTs towards the 3D centre. This distribution is in clear contrast to the experimentally observed distribution in lymphocyte nuclei. We conclude that presently unknown factors (other than topological constraints) may play a decisive role to enforce the different radial arrangements of large and small CTs observed in ellipsoid and spherical human cell nuclei.},

abstract = {Developmental programs are controlled by transcription factors and chromatin regulators, which maintain specific gene expression programs through epigenetic modification of the genome. These regulatory events at enhancers contribute to the specific gene expression programs that determine cell state and the potential for differentiation into new cell types. Although enhancer elements are known to be associated with certain histone modifications and transcription factors, the relationship of these modifications to gene expression and developmental state has not been clearly defined. Here we interrogate the epigenetic landscape of enhancer elements in embryonic stem cells and several adult tissues in the mouse. We find that histone H3K27ac distinguishes active enhancers from inactive/poised enhancer elements containing H3K4me1 alone. This indicates that the amount of actively used enhancers is lower than previously anticipated. Furthermore, poised enhancer networks provide clues to unrealized developmental programs. Finally, we show that enhancers are reset during nuclear reprogramming.},

It is now widely recognized that these regulatory elements can be brought in close proximity through the formation of chromatin loops, and that these loops are crucial for transcriptional regulation of their target genes. The chromosome conformation capture (3C) technique presents a snapshot of long-range interactions, by fixing physically interacting elements with formaldehyde, digestion of the DNA, and ligation to obtain a library of unique ligation products. Recently, several large-scale modifications to the 3C technique have been presented. Here, we describe chromosome conformation capture sequencing (4C-seq), a high-throughput version of the 3C technique that combines the 3C-on-chip (4C) protocol with next-generation Illumina sequencing. The method is presented for use in mammalian cell lines, but can be adapted to use in mammalian tissues and any other eukaryotic genome.},

abstract = {A growing body of evidence points towards epigenetic mechanisms being responsible for a wide range of biological phenomena, from the plasticity of plant growth and development to the nutritional control of caste determination in honeybees and the etiology of human disease (e.g., cancer). With the (partial) elucidation of the molecular basis of epigenetic variation and the heritability of certain of these changes, the field of evolutionary epigenetics is flourishing. Despite this, the role of epigenetics in shaping host-pathogen interactions has received comparatively little attention. Yet there is plenty of evidence supporting the implication of epigenetic mechanisms in the modulation of the biological interaction between hosts and pathogens. The phenotypic plasticity of many key parasite life-history traits appears to be under epigenetic control. Moreover, pathogen-induced effects in host phenotype may have transgenerational consequences, and the bases of these changes and their heritability probably have an epigenetic component. The significance of epigenetic modifications may, however, go beyond providing a mechanistic basis for host and pathogen plasticity. Epigenetic epidemiology has recently emerged as a promising area for future research on infectious diseases. In addition, the incorporation of epigenetic inheritance and epigenetic plasticity mechanisms to evolutionary models and empirical studies of host-pathogen interactions will provide new insights into the evolution and coevolution of these associations. Here, we review the evidence available for the role epigenetics on host-pathogen interactions, and the utility and versatility of the epigenetic technologies available that can be cross-applied to host-pathogen studies. We conclude with recommendations and directions for future research on the burgeoning field of epigenetics as applied to host-pathogen interactions.},

The emerging picture is that the function of DNA methylation seems to vary with context, and the relationship between DNA methylation and transcription is more nuanced than we realized at first.

abstract = {Mesoderm played a crucial role in the radiation of the triploblastic Bilateria, permitting the evolution of larger and more complex body plans than in the diploblastic, non-bilaterian animals. The sea anemone Nematostella is a non-bilaterian animal, a member of the phylum Cnidaria. The phylum Cnidaria (sea anemones, corals, hydras and jellyfish) is the likely sister group of the triploblastic Bilateria. Cnidarians are generally regarded as diploblastic animals, possessing endoderm and ectoderm, but lacking mesoderm. To investigate the origin of triploblasty, we studied the developmental expression of seven genes from Nematostella whose bilaterian homologs are implicated in mesodermal specification and the differentiation of mesodermal cell types (twist, snailA, snailB, forkhead, mef2, a GATA transcription factor and a LIM transcription factor). Except for mef2, the expression of these genes is largely restricted to the endodermal layer, the gastrodermis. mef2 is restricted to the ectoderm. The temporal and spatial expression of these 'mesoderm' genes suggests that they may play a role in germ layer specification. Furthermore, the predominantly endodermal expression of these genes reinforces the hypothesis that the mesoderm and endoderm of triploblastic animals could be derived from the endoderm of a diploblastic ancestor. Alternatively, we consider the possibility that the diploblastic condition of cnidarians is a secondary simplification, derived from an ancestral condition of triploblasty.},

Because these larger fragments may be non-random and represent relevant biology that may otherwise be missed, but also because they represent a significant fraction of the immunoprecipitated material, we designed a double-fragmentation ChIP-seq procedure. After conventional crosslinking and immunoprecipitation, chromatin is de-crosslinked and sheared a second time to concentrate fragments in the optimal size range for NGS. Besides the benefits of increased chromatin yields, the procedure also eliminates a laborious size-selection step. We show that the double-fragmentation ChIP-seq approach allows for the generation of biologically relevant genome-wide protein-DNA binding profiles from sub-nanogram amounts of TCF7L2/TCF4, TBP and H3K4me3 immunoprecipitated material.

It is unclear to what extent chromosome territories occupy particular positions with respect to each other and how structural rearrangements, such as translocations, affect chromosome organization within the cell nucleus. Here we analyze the relative interphase positioning of chromosomes in mouse lymphoma cells compared to normal splenocytes. We show that in a lymphoma cell line derived from an ATM(-/-) mouse, two translocated chromosomes are preferentially positioned in close proximity to each other. The relative position of the chromosomes involved in these translocations is conserved in normal splenocytes. Relative positioning of chromosomes in normal splenocytes is not due to their random distribution in the interphase nucleus and persists during mitosis. These observations demonstrate that the relative arrangement of chromosomes in the interphase nucleus can be conserved between normal and cancer cells and our data support the notion that physical proximity facilitates rearrangements between chromosomes.},

abstract = {Cell-fate transitions involve the integration of genomic information encoded by regulatory elements, such as enhancers, with the cellular environment. However, identification of genomic sequences that control human embryonic development represents a formidable challenge. Here we show that in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), unique chromatin signatures identify two distinct classes of genomic elements, both of which are marked by the presence of chromatin regulators p300 and BRG1, monomethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me1), and low nucleosomal density. In addition, elements of the first class are distinguished by the acetylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27ac), overlap with previously characterized hESC enhancers, and are located proximally to genes expressed in hESCs and the epiblast. In contrast, elements of the second class, which we term 'poised enhancers', are distinguished by the absence of H3K27ac, enrichment of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), and are linked to genes inactive in hESCs and instead are involved in orchestrating early steps in embryogenesis, such as gastrulation, mesoderm formation and neurulation. Consistent with the poised identity, during differentiation of hESCs to neuroepithelium, a neuroectoderm-specific subset of poised enhancers acquires a chromatin signature associated with active enhancers. When assayed in zebrafish embryos, poised enhancers are able to direct cell-type and stage-specific expression characteristic of their proximal developmental gene, even in the absence of sequence conservation in the fish genome. Our data demonstrate that early developmental enhancers are epigenetically pre-marked in hESCs and indicate an unappreciated role of H3K27me3 at distal regulatory elements. Moreover, the wealth of new regulatory sequences identified here provides an invaluable resource for studies and isolation of transient, rare cell populations representing early stages of human embryogenesis.},

abstract = {Higher-order compartments of nuclear chromatin have been defined according to the replication timing, transcriptional activity, and information content (Ferreira et al. 1997, Sadoni et al. 1999). The results presented in this work contribute to this model of nuclear organization. Using different human blood cells, nuclear positioning of genes, centromeres, and whole chromosomes was investigated. Genes are located mostly in the interior of cell nuclei; centromeres are located near the nuclear periphery in agreement with the definition of the higher-order compartments. Genetic loci are found in specific subregions of cell nuclei which form distinct layers at defined centre-of-nucleus to locus distances. Inside these layers, the genetic loci are distributed randomly. Some chromosomes are polarized with genes located in the inner parts of the nucleus and centromere located on the nuclear periphery; polar organization was not found for some other chromosomes. The internal structure of the higher-order compartments as well as the polar and non-polar organization of chromosomes are basically conserved in different cell types and at various stages of the cell cycle. Some features of the nuclear structure are conserved even in differentiated cells and during cellular repair after irradiation, although shifted positioning of genetic loci was systematically observed during these processes.},

Cnidarians are known for the remarkable plasticity of their morphology and life cycles. This plasticity is reflected in the Hydra and Nematostella genomes, which differ to an exceptional degree in size, base composition, transposable element content and gene conservation. It is now known what cnidarian genomes, given 500 million years, are capable of; as we discuss here, the next challenge is to understand how this genomic history has led to the striking diversity seen in this group.},

We show that methylation of plant transposons in the CHG context extends to green algae and that exclusion of histone H2A.Z from methylated DNA is conserved between plants and animals, and we present evidence for RNA-directed DNA methylation of fungal genes. Our data demonstrate that extant DNA methylation systems are mosaics of conserved and derived features, and indicate that gene body methylation is an ancient property of eukaryotic genomes.},

abstract = {Development requires the establishment of precise patterns of gene expression, which are primarily controlled by transcription factors binding to cis-regulatory modules. Although transcription factor occupancy can now be identified at genome-wide scales, decoding this regulatory landscape remains a daunting challenge. Here we used a novel approach to predict spatio-temporal cis-regulatory activity based only on in vivo transcription factor binding and enhancer activity data. We generated a high-resolution atlas of cis-regulatory modules describing their temporal and combinatorial occupancy during Drosophila mesoderm development. The binding profiles of cis-regulatory modules with characterized expression were used to train support vector machines to predict five spatio-temporal expression patterns. In vivo transgenic reporter assays demonstrate the high accuracy of these predictions and reveal an unanticipated plasticity in transcription factor binding leading to similar expression. This data-driven approach does not require previous knowledge of transcription factor sequence affinity, function or expression, making it widely applicable.},

abstract = {Establishing the age of each mutation segregating in contemporary human populations is important to fully understand our evolutionary history and will help to facilitate the development of new approaches for disease-gene discovery. Large-scale surveys of human genetic variation have reported signatures of recent explosive population growth, notable for an excess of rare genetic variants, suggesting that many mutations arose recently. To more quantitatively assess the distribution of mutation ages, we resequenced 15,336 genes in 6,515 individuals of European American and African American ancestry and inferred the age of 1,146,401 autosomal single nucleotide variants (SNVs). We estimate that approximately 73\% of all protein-coding SNVs and approximately 86\% of SNVs predicted to be deleterious arose in the past 5,000-10,000 years. The average age of deleterious SNVs varied significantly across molecular pathways, and disease genes contained a significantly higher proportion of recently arisen deleterious SNVs than other genes. Furthermore, European Americans had an excess of deleterious variants in essential and Mendelian disease genes compared to African Americans, consistent with weaker purifying selection due to the Out-of-Africa dispersal. Our results better delimit the historical details of human protein-coding variation, show the profound effect of recent human history on the burden of deleterious SNVs segregating in contemporary populations, and provide important practical information that can be used to prioritize variants in disease-gene discovery.},

abstract = {The ENCODE Project has generated a wealth of experimental information mapping diverse chromatin properties in several human cell lines. Although each such data track is independently informative toward the annotation of regulatory elements, their interrelations contain much richer information for the systematic annotation of regulatory elements. To uncover these interrelations and to generate an interpretable summary of the massive datasets of the ENCODE Project, we apply unsupervised learning methodologies, converting dozens of chromatin datasets into discrete annotation maps of regulatory regions and other chromatin elements across the human genome. These methods rediscover and summarize diverse aspects of chromatin architecture, elucidate the interplay between chromatin activity and RNA transcription, and reveal that a large proportion of the genome lies in a quiescent state, even across multiple cell types. The resulting annotation of non-coding regulatory elements correlate strongly with mammalian evolutionary constraint, and provide an unbiased approach for evaluating metrics of evolutionary constraint in human.

abstract = {Localizing the binding sites of regulatory proteins is becoming increasingly feasible and accurate. This is due to dramatic progress not only in chromatin immunoprecipitation combined by next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) but also in advanced statistical analyses. A fundamental issue, however, is the alarming number of false positive predictions. This problem can be remedied by improved peak calling methods of twin peaks, one at each strand of the DNA, kernel density estimators, and false discovery rate estimations based on control libraries. Predictions are filtered by de novo motif discovery in the peak environments. These methods have been implemented in, among others, Valouev et al.'s Quantitative Enrichment of Sequence Tags (QuEST) software tool. We demonstrate the prediction of the human growth-associated binding protein (GABPalpha) based on ChIP-seq observations.},

abstract = {The sea anemone Nematostella vectensis has recently been established as a new model system for the understanding of the evolution of developmental processes. In particular, the evolutionary origin of gastrulation and its molecular regulation are the subject of intense investigation. However, while molecular data are rapidly accumulating, no detailed morphological data exist describing the process of gastrulation. Here, we carried out an ultrastructural study of different stages of gastrulation in Nematostella using transmission electron microscope and scanning electron microscopy techniques. We show that presumptive endodermal cells undergo a change in cell shape, reminiscent of the bottle cells known from vertebrates and several invertebrates. Presumptive endodermal cells organize into a field, the pre-endodermal plate, which undergoes invagination. In parallel, the endodermal cells decrease their apical cell contacts but remain loosely attached to each other. Hence, during early gastrulation they display an incomplete epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). At a late stage of gastrulation, the cells eventually detach and fill the interior of the blastocoel as mesenchymal cells. This shows that gastrulation in Nematostella occurs by a combination of invagination and late immigration involving EMT. The comparison with molecular expression studies suggests that cells expressing snailA undergo EMT and become endodermal, whereas forkhead/brachyury expressing cells at the ectodermal margin of the blastopore retain their epithelial integrity throughout gastrulation.},

One interesting aspect of this diversity of cell type is that many cells in diploid organisms are polyploid. This is called endopolyploidy and arises from cell cycles that are often characterized as "variant," but in fact are widespread throughout nature. Endopolyploidy is essential for normal development and physiology in many different organisms. Here we review how both plants and animals use variations of the cell cycle, termed collectively as endoreplication, resulting in polyploid cells that support specific aspects of development. In addition, we discuss briefly how endoreplication occurs in response to certain physiological stresses, and how it may contribute to the development of cancer. Finally, we describe the molecular mechanisms that support the onset and progression of endoreplication.},

Increasing sequence data has made it possible to utilize related genomes, but this is not as straightforward as it may seem, as the evolution of noncoding regulatory regions is relatively poorly understood. In this work we describe a modeling framework and software implementation for aligning multiple DNA sequences to each other while simultaneously predicting functional regions in that DNA (such as the locations where proteins bind to the DNA for the purpose of regulating genes). Those functional regions may or may not be evolutionarily conserved across the sequences. Our framework allows for explicit modeling of evolutionary change across sequences in both the individual nucleotides making up the sequences and in the functional significance of the sequences (functional versus nonfunctional). While most competing frameworks and implementations are limited to a maximum number of sequences and their lengths, ours is scalable. We demonstrate the value of our system by using it to align a set of complex regulatory regions across ten Drosophila species and to predict protein-binding sites in those sequences.},

abstract = {The sea anemone, Nematostella vectensis, has become an attractive new model organism for comparative genomics and evolutionary developmental biology. Over the last few years, many genes have been isolated and their expression patterns studied to gain insight into their function. More recently, functional tools have been developed to manipulate gene function; however, most of these approaches rely on microinjection and are limited to early stages of development. Transgenic lines would significantly enhance the tractability of the system. In particular, the study of gene- or tissue-specific promoters would be most useful. Here we report the stable establishment of a transgenic line using the I-SceI meganuclease system to facilitate integration into the genome. We isolated a 1.6-kb fragment of the regulatory upstream region of the Myosin Heavy Chain1 (MyHC1) gene and found that the transgene is specifically expressed in the retractor and tentacle muscles of Nematostella polyps, faithfully reproducing the expression of the endogenous MyHC1 gene. This demonstrates that the 1.6-kb fragment contains all of the regulatory elements necessary to drive correct expression and suggests that retractor and tentacle muscles in Nematostella are distinct from other myoepithelial cells. The transgene is transmitted through the germline at high frequency, and G(1) transgenic polyps have only one integration site. The relatively high frequency of transgenesis, in combination with gene- or tissue-specific promoters, will foster experimental possibilities for studying in vivo gene functions in gene regulatory networks and developmental processes in the nonbilaterian sea anemone, Nematostella vectensis.},

@article{Scherrer2007,
abstract = {We analyse here the definition of the gene in order to distinguish, on the basis of modern insight in molecular biology, what the gene is coding for, namely a specific polypeptide, and how its expression is realized and controlled. Before the coding role of the DNA was discovered, a gene was identified with a specific phenotypic trait, from Mendel through Morgan up to Benzer. Subsequently, however, molecular biologists ventured to define a gene at the level of the DNA sequence in terms of coding. As is becoming ever more evident, the relations between information stored at DNA level and functional products are very intricate, and the regulatory aspects are as important and essential as the information coding for products. This approach led, thus, to a conceptual hybrid that confused coding, regulation and functional aspects. In this essay, we develop a definition of the gene that once again starts from the functional aspect. A cellular function can be represented by a polypeptide or an RNA. In the case of the polypeptide, its biochemical identity is determined by the mRNA prior to translation, and that is where we locate the gene. The steps from specific, but possibly separated sequence fragments at DNA level to that final mRNA then can be analysed in terms of regulation. For that purpose, we coin the new term "genon". In that manner, we can clearly separate product and regulative information while keeping the fundamental relation between coding and function without the need to introduce a conceptual hybrid. In mRNA, the program regulating the expression of a gene is superimposed onto and added to the coding sequence in cis - we call it the genon. The complementary external control of a given mRNA by trans-acting factors is incorporated in its transgenon. A consequence of this definition is that, in eukaryotes, the gene is, in most cases, not yet present at DNA level. Rather, it is assembled by RNA processing, including differential splicing, from various pieces, as steered by the genon. It emerges finally as an uninterrupted nucleic acid sequence at mRNA level just prior to translation, in faithful correspondence with the amino acid sequence to be produced as a polypeptide. After translation, the genon has fulfilled its role and expires. The distinction between the protein coding information as materialised in the final polypeptide and the processing information represented by the genon allows us to set up a new information theoretic scheme. The standard sequence information determined by the genetic code expresses the relation between coding sequence and product. Backward analysis asks from which coding region in the DNA a given polypeptide originates. The (more interesting) forward analysis asks in how many polypeptides of how many different types a given DNA segment is expressed. This concerns the control of the expression process for which we have introduced the genon concept. Thus, the information theoretic analysis can capture the complementary aspects of coding and regulation, of gene and genon.},

abstract = {The role of Brachyury and other T-box genes in the differentiation of mesoderm and endoderm of vertebrates is well established. Recently, homologues of Brachyury have been isolated from an increasing number of diverse organisms ranging from Cnidaria to vertebrates and insects. Comparative expression and function analysis allows the origin of the mesoderm and the evolution of the developmental role of Brachyury gene family in metazoans to be traced. The data suggest that an ancestral function of Brachyury was to designate a blastoporal region that had distinct properties in induction and axis elongation. A subset of blastoporal cells expressing Brachyury and other genes that convey specific mesodermal functions may have segregated as a distinct cell population from this region in the course of mesoderm evolution.},

abstract = {Molecular interactions between protein complexes and DNA mediate essential gene-regulatory functions. Uncovering such interactions by chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-Seq) has recently become the focus of intense interest. We here introduce quantitative enrichment of sequence tags (QuEST), a powerful statistical framework based on the kernel density estimation approach, which uses ChIP-Seq data to determine positions where protein complexes contact DNA. Using QuEST, we discovered several thousand binding sites for the human transcription factors SRF, GABP and NRSF at an average resolution of about 20 base pairs. MEME motif-discovery tool-based analyses of the QuEST-identified sequences revealed DNA binding by cofactors of SRF, providing evidence that cofactor binding specificity can be obtained from ChIP-Seq data. By combining QuEST analyses with Gene Ontology (GO) annotations and expression data, we illustrate how general functions of transcription factors can be inferred.},

We quantified DNA methylation in 17 eukaryotic genomes and found that gene body methylation is conserved between plants and animals, whereas selective methylation of transposons is not. We show that methylation of plant transposons in the CHG context extends to green algae and that exclusion of histone H2A.Z from methylated DNA is conserved between plants and animals, and we present evidence for RNA-directed DNA methylation of fungal genes. Our data demonstrate that extant DNA methylation systems are mosaics of conserved and derived features, and indicate that gene body methylation is an ancient property of eukaryotic genomes.},

Experimental studies of Hydra between 1736 and 1744 culminated in the discovery of asexual reproduction of an animal by budding, the first description of regeneration in an animal, and successful transplantation of tissue between animals. Today, Hydra is an important model for studies of axial patterning, stem cell biology and regeneration. Here we report the genome of Hydra magnipapillata and compare it to the genomes of the anthozoan Nematostella vectensis and other animals. The Hydra genome has been shaped by bursts of transposable element expansion, horizontal gene transfer, trans-splicing, and simplification of gene structure and gene content that parallel simplification of the Hydra life cycle. We also report the sequence of the genome of a novel bacterium stably associated with H. magnipapillata. Comparisons of the Hydra genome to the genomes of other animals shed light on the evolution of epithelia, contractile tissues, developmentally regulated transcription factors, the Spemann-Mangold organizer, pluripotency genes and the neuromuscular junction.},

abstract = {To generate stable lines of transgenic fish, early zebrafish embryos were injected with high concentrations of a linear bacterial plasmid. After injection, the foreign DNA was converted into a high molecular weight form and then amplified approximately tenfold during the initial rapid cleavages characteristic of the early embryo prior to gastrulation. While most of this DNA was subsequently degraded during gastrulation, some of the foreign sequences survived the gastrula stage and could be found in most of the injected fish at 3 weeks of age. Only about 5\% of fish analysed 4 months after the injection retained foreign DNA in their fins, usually at less than one copy per cell. One of these fish was also found to contain about 100 copies per cell of foreign DNA in a fraction of its germ cells. Approximately 20\% of the F1 offspring from this germ-line-positive parent inherited the foreign DNA, whereas 50\% of F2 progeny obtained from an identified F1 individual inherited these sequences. The 50\% transmission rate in F2 progeny was as expected for a single, heterozygous genomic insert. These observations indicate that injected DNA can be integrated into the fish genome, that the resulting transgenic fish are mosaic and that some of these mosaic individuals give rise to stable lines of transgenic fish.},

abstract = {The Tol2 transposable element is a powerful genetic tool in model vertebrates and has been used for transgenesis, insertional mutagenesis, gene trapping, and enhancer trapping. However, an in vivo transposition system using Tol2 has not yet been developed. Here we report the in vivo Tol2 transposition system in a model vertebrate, zebrafish. First, we constructed transgenic zebrafish that carried single-copy integrations of Tol2 on the genome and injected transposase mRNA into one-cell stage embryos. The Tol2 insertions were mobilized efficiently in the germ lineage. We then mobilized an insertion of the Tol2 gene trap construct in the nup214 gene, which caused a recessive lethal mutant phenotype, and demonstrated that this method is applicable to the isolation of revertants from a transposon insertional mutant. Second, we constructed transgenic fish carrying the transposase cDNA under the control of the hsp70 promoter. Double-transgenic fish containing the transposase gene and a single-copy Tol2 insertion were treated with heat shock at the adult stage. We found that transposition can be induced efficiently in the male germ cells. We analyzed new integration sites and found that the majority (83\%) of them were mapped on chromosomes other than the transposon donor chromosomes and that 9\% of local hopping events mapped less than 300 kb away from the donor loci. Our present study demonstrates that the in vivo Tol2 transposition system is useful for creating genome-wide insertions from a single-copy donor and should facilitate functional genomics and transposon biology in vertebrates.},

abstract = {The Tol2 element is a naturally occurring active transposable element found in vertebrate genomes. The Tol2 transposon system has been shown to be active from fish to mammals and considered to be a useful gene transfer vector in vertebrates. However, cis-sequences essential for transposition have not been characterized. Here we report the characterization of the minimal cis-sequence of the Tol2 element. We constructed Tol2 vectors containing various lengths of DNA from both the left (5') and the right (3') ends and tested their transpositional activities both by the transient excision assay using zebrafish embryos and by analyzing chromosomal transposition in the zebrafish germ lineage. We demonstrated that Tol2 vectors with 200 bp from the left end and 150 bp from the right end were capable of transposition without reducing the transpositional efficiency and found that these sequences, including the terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) and the subterminal regions, are sufficient and required for transposition. The left and right ends were not interchangeable. The Tol2 vector carrying an insert of >11 kb could transpose, but a certain length of spacer, <276 but >18 bp, between the left and right ends was necessary for excision. Furthermore, we found that a 5-bp sequence, 5'-(A/G)AGTA-3', is repeated 33 times in the essential subterminal region. Mutations in the repeat sequence at 13 different sites in the subterminal region, as well as mutations in TIRs, severely reduced the excision activity, indicating that they play important roles in transposition. The identification of the minimal cis-sequence of the Tol2 element and the construction of mini-Tol2 vectors will facilitate development of useful transposon tools in vertebrates. Also, our study established a basis for further biochemical and molecular biological studies for understanding roles of the repetitive sequence in the subterminal region in transposition.},

A putative thrombin cleavage site (LDPR/S) resembling the activation cleavage site in the zymogen protein C (LDPR/I) was noted 41 amino acids carboxyl to the receptor's start methionine. A peptide mimicking the new amino terminus created by cleavage at R41 was a potent agonist for both thrombin receptor activation and platelet activation. "Uncleavable" mutant thrombin receptors failed to respond to thrombin but were responsive to the new amino-terminal peptide. These data reveal a novel signaling mechanism in which thrombin cleaves its receptor's amino-terminal extension to create a new receptor amino terminus that functions as a tethered ligand and activates the receptor.},

abstract = {Annotating repetitive regions of genomes experimentally is a challenging task. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) provides valuable data for characterizing repetitive regions of genomes in terms of transcription factor binding. Although ChIP-seq technology has been maturing, available ChIP-seq analysis methods and software rely on discarding sequence reads that map to multiple locations on the reference genome (multi-reads), thereby generating a missed opportunity for assessing transcription factor binding to highly repetitive regions of genomes. We develop a computational algorithm that takes multi-reads into account in ChIP-seq analysis. We show with computational experiments that multi-reads lead to significant increase in sequencing depths and identification of binding regions that are otherwise not identifiable when only reads that uniquely map to the reference genome (uni-reads) are used. In particular, we show that the number of binding regions identified can increase up to 36\%. We support our computational predictions with independent quantitative real-time ChIP validation of binding regions identified only when multi-reads are incorporated in the analysis of a mouse GATA1 ChIP-seq experiment.},

Aberrant gene expression and altered epigenomic patterns are major features of cancer. Epigenetic changes including histone acetylation, histone methylation, and DNA methylation are now thought to play important roles in the onset and progression of cancer in numerous tumor types. Indeed dysregulated epigenetic modifications, especially in early neoplastic development, may be just as significant as genetic mutations in driving cancer development and growth. The reversal of aberrant epigenetic changes has therefore emerged as a potential strategy for the treatment of cancer. A number of compounds targeting enzymes that regulate histone acetylation, histone methylation, and DNA methylation have been developed as epigenetic therapies, with some demonstrating efficacy in hematological malignancies and solid tumors. This review highlights the roles of epigenetic modifications to histones and DNA in tumorigenesis and emerging epigenetic therapies being developed for the treatment of cancer.},

abstract = {Extracellular matrices regulate biological processes at the level of cells, tissues, and in some cases, entire multicellular organisms. The subphylum Urochordata exemplifies the latter case, where animals are partially or completely enclosed in "houses" or "tunics". Despite this common strategy, we show that the house proteome of the appendicularian, Oikopleura, has very little in common with the proteome of the sister class, ascidian, Ciona. Of 80 identified house proteins (oikosins), ∼half lack domain modules or similarity to known proteins, suggesting de novo appearance in appendicularians. Gene duplication has been important in generating almost 1/3 of the current oikosin complement, with serial duplications up to 8 paralogs in one family. Expression pattern analyses revealed that individual oikosins are produced from specific fields of cells within the secretory epithelium, but in some cases, migrate up to at least 20 cell diameters in extracellular space to combine in defined house structures. Interestingly, peroxidasin and secretory phospholipase A(2) domains, implicated in innate immune defence are secreted from the anlage associated with the food-concentrating filter, suggesting that this extra-organismal structure may play, in part, such a role in Oikopleura. We also show that sulfation of proteoglycans is required for the hydration and inflation of pre-house rudiments into functional houses. Though correct proportioning in the production of oikosins would seem important in repetitive assembly of the complex house structure, the genomic organization of oikosin loci appears incompatible with common enhancers or locus control regions exerting such a coordinate regulatory role. Thus, though all tunicates employ extracellular matrices based on a cellulose scaffold as a defining feature of the subphylum, they have evolved radically different protein compositions associated with this common underlying structural theme.},

To define the mechanism through which demethylated cells die, and to establish a paradigm for identifying genes regulated by DNA methylation, we have generated mice with a conditional allele for the maintenance DNA methyltransferase gene Dnmt1. Cre-mediated deletion of Dnmt1 causes demethylation of cultured fibroblasts and a uniform p53-dependent cell death. Mutational inactivation of Trp53 partially rescues the demethylated fibroblasts for up to five population doublings in culture. Oligonucleotide microarray analysis showed that up to 10\% of genes are aberrantly expressed in demethylated fibroblasts. Our results demonstrate that loss of Dnmt1 causes cell-type-specific changes in gene expression that impinge on several pathways, including expression of imprinted genes, cell-cycle control, growth factor/receptor signal transduction and mobilization of retroelements.},

abstract = {Deregulation of the transforming growth factor-$\beta$ (TGF$\beta$) signaling pathway in epithelial ovarian cancer has been reported, but the precise mechanism underlying disrupted TGF$\beta$ signaling in the disease remains unclear. We performed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) to investigate genome-wide screening of TGF$\beta$-induced SMAD4 binding in epithelial ovarian cancer. Following TGF$\beta$ stimulation of the A2780 epithelial ovarian cancer cell line, we identified 2,362 SMAD4 binding loci and 318 differentially expressed SMAD4 target genes. Comprehensive examination of SMAD4-bound loci, revealed four distinct binding patterns: 1) Basal; 2) Shift; 3) Stimulated Only; 4) Unstimulated Only. TGF$\beta$ stimulated SMAD4-bound loci were primarily classified as either Stimulated only (74\%) or Shift (25\%), indicating that TGF$\beta$-stimulation alters SMAD4 binding patterns in epithelial ovarian cancer cells. Furthermore, based on gene regulatory network analysis, we determined that the TGF$\beta$-induced, SMAD4-dependent regulatory network was strikingly different in ovarian cancer compared to normal cells. Importantly, the TGF$\beta$/SMAD4 target genes identified in the A2780 epithelial ovarian cancer cell line were predictive of patient survival, based on in silico mining of publically available patient data bases. In conclusion, our data highlight the utility of next generation sequencing technology to identify genome-wide SMAD4 target genes in epithelial ovarian cancer and link aberrant TGF$\beta$/SMAD signaling to ovarian tumorigenesis. Furthermore, the identified SMAD4 binding loci, combined with gene expression profiling and in silico data mining of patient cohorts, may provide a powerful approach to determine potential gene signatures with biological and future translational research in ovarian and other cancers.},

We find that C. elegans genes show distributions of histone modifications that are similar to those of other organisms, with H3K4me3 near transcription start sites, H3K36me3 in the body of genes and H3K9me3 enriched on silent genes. We also observe a novel pattern: exons are preferentially marked with H3K36me3 relative to introns. H3K36me3 exon marking is dependent on transcription and is found at lower levels in alternatively spliced exons, supporting a splicing-related marking mechanism. We further show that the difference in H3K36me3 marking between exons and introns is evolutionarily conserved in human and mouse. We propose that H3K36me3 exon marking in chromatin provides a dynamic link between transcription and splicing.},

abstract = {Most human diseases are related in some way to the loss or gain in gene functions. Regulation of gene expression is a complex process. In addition to genetic mechanisms, epigenetic causes are gaining new perspectives in human diseases related to gene deregulation. Most eukaryotic genes are packed into chromatin structures, which lead to high condensations of the genes that require dynamic chromatin remodeling processes to facilitate their transcription. DNA methylation and histone modifications represent two of the major chromatin remodeling processes. They also serve to integrate environmental signals for the cells to modulate the functional output of their genome. Complex human diseases such as cancer and type 2 diabetes are believed to have a strong environmental component in addition to genetic causes. Aberrancies in chromatin remodeling are associated with both genetically and environmentally-related diseases. We will focus on recent findings of the epigenetic basis of human metabolic disorders to facilitate further exploration of epigenetic mechanisms and better understandings of the molecular cues underlying such complex diseases.},

The evolutionary origin of the inner germ layers, endoderm and mesoderm, and their relationship have been a matter of debate for decades. In this review we summarize the major modes of endoderm and mesoderm formation found in Metazoa and possible evolutionary scenarios to reconstruct the ancestral state. In the second part, we address the question whether endoderm as well as mesoderm are homologous among Bilateria. In this regard, we propose that the comparative analysis of some crucial transcription factors involved in the early specification and differentiation of these germ layers might provide cues for the level of homology. We focus on four classes of genes: the Zn-finger gene GATA 4-6, the bHLH gene twist, the Kr\"{u}ppel-like Zn-finger gene snail and the T-box gene brachyury. The role of each of these genes in mesendoderm formation is summarized and we propose that the specific function of each of these genes in endoderm and mesoderm formation evolved from the regulation of basic cellular features, such as cell adhesion, cell motility, cytoskeleton and cell cycle.},

abstract = {The gene density of eukaryotic nuclear genomes is generally low relative to prokaryotes, but several eukaryotic lineages (many parasites or endosymbionts) have independently evolved highly compacted, gene-dense genomes. The best studied of these are the microsporidia, highly adapted fungal parasites, and the nucleomorphs, relict nuclei of endosymbiotic algae found in cryptomonads and chlorarachniophytes. These systems are now models for the effects of compaction on the form and dynamics of the nuclear genome. Here we report a large-scale investigation of gene expression from compacted eukaryotic genomes. We have conducted EST surveys of the microsporidian Antonospora locustae and nucleomorphs of the cryptomonad Guillardia theta and the chlorarachniophyte Bigelowiella natans. In all three systems we find a high frequency of mRNA molecules that encode sequence from more than one gene. There is no bias for these genes to be on the same strand, so it is unlikely that these mRNAs represent operons. Instead, compaction appears to have reduced the intergenic regions to such an extent that control elements like promoters and terminators have been forced into or beyond adjacent genes, resulting in long untranslated regions that encode other genes. Normally, transcriptional overlap can interfere with expression of a gene, but these genomes cope with high frequencies of overlap and with termination signals within expressed genes. These findings also point to serious practical difficulties in studying expression in compacted genomes, because many techniques, such as arrays or serial analysis of gene expression will be misleading.},

abstract = {Homologues of the T-box gene Brachyury play important roles in mesoderm differentiation and other aspects of early development in all bilaterians. In the diploblast Hydra, the Brachyury homologue HyBra1 acts early in the formation of the hypostome, the location of the organiser in adult Hydra. We now report the isolation and characterisation of a second Brachyury gene, HyBra2. Sequence analysis suggests that HyBra1 and HyBra2 are paralogues, resulting from an ancient lineage-specific gene duplication. We show that both paralogues acquired novel functions, both at the level of their cis-regulation as well as through significant divergence of the coding sequence. Both genes are expressed in the hypostome, but HyBra1 is predominantly endodermal, whereas HyBra2 transcripts are found primarily in the ectoderm. During bud formation, both genes are activated before any sign of evagination, suggesting an early role in head formation. During regeneration, HyBra1 is an immediate-early response gene and is insensitive to protein synthesis inhibition, whereas the onset of expression of HyBra2 is delayed and requires protein synthesis. The functional consequence of HyBra1/2 protein divergence on cell fate decisions was tested in Xenopus. HyBra1 induces mesoderm, like vertebrate Brachyury proteins. By contrast, HyBra2 shows a strong cement-gland and neural-inducing activity. Domain-swapping experiments show that the C-terminal domain of HyBra2 is responsible for this specific phenotype. Our data support the concept of sub- and neofunctionalisation upon gene duplication and show that divergence of cis-regulation and coding sequence in paralogues can lead to dramatic changes in structure and function.},

abstract = {GnRH, a neuropeptide produced by rare, specialized hypothalamic secretory neurons, is critical for reproduction. During development, GnRH gene expression increases as neurons migrate from the olfactory placode to the hypothalamus, with highest levels in the mature, postmitotic state. While neuronal differentiation is known to be controlled by chromatin modulations, the role of chromatin dynamics in GnRH gene regulation has not been studied. Here, we use mature and immature GnRH neuronal cell models to show that both neuron-specific and protein kinase C regulation of GnRH expression are mediated by chromatin structure and histone modifications. Only in GT1-7 mature GnRH neuronal cells did GnRH regulatory elements display high sensitivity to DNase and enrichment of active histone markers histone-H3 acetylation and H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4-Me3), as well as RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) binding and enhancer RNA transcription. In contrast, H3K9-Me2, a marker of inactive chromatin, was highest in nonneuronal cells, low in GT1-7 cells, and intermediate in immature GnRH neuronal cells. The chromatin of the GnRH gene was therefore active in mature GnRH neuronal cells, inactive in nonneuronal cells, but not fully inactive in immature GnRH neuronal cells. Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) potently represses GnRH expression. PKC activation caused closing of the chromatin and decreased RNAPII occupancy at the GnRH minimal promoter (-278/-97). At GnRH-Enhancer-1 (-2404/-2100), PKC activation decreased phosphorylated-RNAPII binding, enhancer RNA transcription, and H3 acetylation, and reciprocally increased H3K9-Me2. Chromatin modifications therefore participate in the dynamic regulation and specification of GnRH expression to differentiated hypothalamic neurons.},

abstract = {A central unresolved problem of evolutionary biology concerns the way in which evolution at the genotypic level relates to the evolution of phenotypes. This genotype-phenotype map involves developmental and physiological processes, which are complex and not well understood. These processes co-determine the rate and direction of adaptive change by shaping the distribution of phenotypic variability on which selection can act. In this study, we argue-expanding on earlier ideas by Goodwin, Oster, and Alberch-that an explicit treatment of this map in terms of dynamical systems theory can provide an integrated understanding of evolution and development. We describe a conceptual framework, which demonstrates how development determines the probability of possible phenotypic transitions-and hence the evolvability of a biological system. We use a simple conceptual model to illustrate how the regulatory dynamics of the genotype-phenotype map can be passed on from generation to generation, and how heredity itself can be treated as a dynamic process. Our model yields explanations for punctuated evolutionary dynamics, the difference between micro- and macroevolution, and for the role of the environment in major phenotypic transitions. We propose a quantitative research program in evolutionary developmental systems biology-combining experimental methods with mathematical modeling-which aims at elaborating our conceptual framework by applying it to a wide range of evolving developmental systems. This requires a large and sustained effort, which we believe is justified by the significant potential benefits of an extended evolutionary theory that uses dynamic molecular genetic data to reintegrate development and evolution.},

An exciting, new chapter in the field is the finding that long-distance chromosomal interactions also modify gene expression. Epigenetic modifications are key regulators of important developmental events, including X-inactivation, genomic imprinting, patterning by Hox genes and neuronal development.

abstract = {RNA polymerase III (Pol III) is one of three eukaryotic transcription complexes, and was identified as the complex responsible for production of transfer RNA and a limited number of other small RNAs. Pol III transcription at tRNA genes (tDNAs) requires the binding of two transcription factor complexes, TFIIIC and TFIIIB. Recent evidence points to a larger role for the Pol III transcription system in various other nuclear processes, including effects on nucleosome positioning, global genome and sub-nuclear organization, and direct effects on RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription. These effects are perhaps mediated by recruitment of a host of other chromatin proteins, including Pol II transcription factors and chromatin enzymes. Extra-TFIIIC sites (ETC sites) are chromosomal locations bound by TFIIIC without the rest of the Pol III complex, and bound TFIIIC alone is also able to mediate additional functions. These so called "extra-transcriptional effects" of the Pol III system are reviewed here, and a model is put forth suggesting that the TFIIIC transcription factor may act as a stably bound, global "bookmark" within chromatin to establish, maintain, or demarcate chromatin states as cells divide or change gene expression patterns.},

The approach is especially well suited to the characterization of non-coding portions of the genome, which critically contribute to cellular phenotypes yet remain largely uncharted. Here we map nine chromatin marks across nine cell types to systematically characterize regulatory elements, their cell-type specificities and their functional interactions. Focusing on cell-type-specific patterns of promoters and enhancers, we define multicell activity profiles for chromatin state, gene expression, regulatory motif enrichment and regulator expression. We use correlations between these profiles to link enhancers to putative target genes, and predict the cell-type-specific activators and repressors that modulate them. The resulting annotations and regulatory predictions have implications for the interpretation of genome-wide association studies. Top-scoring disease single nucleotide polymorphisms are frequently positioned within enhancer elements specifically active in relevant cell types, and in some cases affect a motif instance for a predicted regulator, thus suggesting a mechanism for the association. Our study presents a general framework for deciphering cis-regulatory connections and their roles in disease.},

abstract = {DNA and histone methylation are linked and subjected to mitotic inheritance in mammals. Yet how methylation is propagated and maintained between successive cell divisions is not fully understood. A series of enzyme families that can add methylation marks to cytosine nucleobases, and lysine and arginine amino acid residues has been discovered. Apart from methyltransferases, there are also histone modification enzymes and accessory proteins, which can facilitate and/or target epigenetic marks. Several lysine and arginine demethylases have been discovered recently, and the presence of an active DNA demethylase is speculated in mammalian cells. A mammalian methyl DNA binding protein MBD2 and de novo DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A and DNMT3B are shown experimentally to possess DNA demethylase activity. Thus, complex mammalian epigenetic mechanisms appear to be dynamic yet reversible along with a well-choreographed set of events that take place during mammalian development.},

By mapping Pol III occupancy genome-wide in mouse, rat, human, macaque, dog and opossum livers, we found that Pol III binding to individual tRNA genes varies substantially in strength and location. However, when we took into account tRNA redundancies by grouping Pol III occupancy into 46 anticodon isoacceptor families or 21 amino acid-based isotype classes, we discovered strong conservation. Similarly, Pol III occupancy of amino acid isotypes is almost invariant among transcriptionally and evolutionarily diverse tissues in mouse. Thus, synthesis of functional tRNA isotypes has been highly constrained, although the usage of individual tRNA genes has evolved rapidly.},

abstract = {Mesoderm played a crucial role in the radiation of the triploblastic Bilateria, permitting the evolution of larger and more complex body plans than in the diploblastic, non-bilaterian animals. The sea anemone Nematostella is a non-bilaterian animal, a member of the phylum Cnidaria. The phylum Cnidaria (sea anemones, corals, hydras and jellyfish) is the likely sister group of the triploblastic Bilateria. Cnidarians are generally regarded as diploblastic animals, possessing endoderm and ectoderm, but lacking mesoderm. To investigate the origin of triploblasty, we studied the developmental expression of seven genes from Nematostella whose bilaterian homologs are implicated in mesodermal specification and the differentiation of mesodermal cell types (twist, snailA, snailB, forkhead, mef2, a GATA transcription factor and a LIM transcription factor). Except for mef2, the expression of these genes is largely restricted to the endodermal layer, the gastrodermis. mef2 is restricted to the ectoderm. The temporal and spatial expression of these 'mesoderm' genes suggests that they may play a role in germ layer specification. Furthermore, the predominantly endodermal expression of these genes reinforces the hypothesis that the mesoderm and endoderm of triploblastic animals could be derived from the endoderm of a diploblastic ancestor. Alternatively, we consider the possibility that the diploblastic condition of cnidarians is a secondary simplification, derived from an ancestral condition of triploblasty.},

abstract = {Mammals use DNA methylation for the heritable silencing of retrotransposons and imprinted genes and for the inactivation of the X chromosome in females. The establishment of patterns of DNA methylation during gametogenesis depends in part on DNMT3L, an enzymatically inactive regulatory factor that is related in sequence to the DNA methyltransferases DNMT3A and DNMT3B. The main proteins that interact in vivo with the product of an epitope-tagged allele of the endogenous Dnmt3L gene were identified by mass spectrometry as DNMT3A2, DNMT3B and the four core histones. Peptide interaction assays showed that DNMT3L specifically interacts with the extreme amino terminus of histone H3; this interaction was strongly inhibited by methylation at lysine 4 of histone H3 but was insensitive to modifications at other positions. Crystallographic studies of human DNMT3L showed that the protein has a carboxy-terminal methyltransferase-like domain and an N-terminal cysteine-rich domain. Cocrystallization of DNMT3L with the tail of histone H3 revealed that the tail bound to the cysteine-rich domain of DNMT3L, and substitution of key residues in the binding site eliminated the H3 tail-DNMT3L interaction. These data indicate that DNMT3L recognizes histone H3 tails that are unmethylated at lysine 4 and induces de novo DNA methylation by recruitment or activation of DNMT3A2.},

Threshold Gcm/Glide levels control the glial versus neuronal fate choice, and its perdurance triggers excessive gliogenesis, showing that its tight and dynamic regulation ensures the proper balance between neurons and glia. Here, we present a genetic screen for potential gcm/glide interactors and identify genes encoding chromatin factors of the Trithorax and of the Polycomb groups. These proteins maintain the heritable epigenetic state, among others, of HOX genes throughout development, but their regulatory role on transiently expressed genes remains elusive. Here we show that Polycomb negatively affects Gcm/Glide autoregulation, a positive feedback loop that allows timely accumulation of Gcm/Glide threshold levels. Such temporal fine-tuning of gene expression tightly controls gliogenesis. This work performed at the levels of individual cells reveals an undescribed mode of Polycomb action in the modulation of transiently expressed fate determinants and hence in the acquisition of specific cell identity in the nervous system.},

abstract = {Epigenetic alterations, represented by aberrant DNA methylation, are deeply involved in human cancers. In gastric cancers, tumor-suppressor genes are inactivated more frequently by promoter methylation than by mutations. We recently showed that H. pylori infection, a potent gastric carcinogenic factor, induces methylation of specific genes in the gastric mucosae. When the methylation levels were analyzed in the gastric mucosae of healthy volunteers, cases with a single gastric cancer, and cases with multiple gastric cancers, who have increasing levels of risks for gastric cancers, there was a significant increasing trend in the methylation levels among the individuals without current H. pylori infection. This finding unequivocally showed the presence of an epigenetic field for cancerization. The degree of the field defect was measured more conveniently using methylation levels of marker genes than using those of tumor-suppressor genes. The presence of an epigenetic field for cancerization has been indicated for liver, colon, Barrett's esophageal, lung, breast, and renal cancers. Since decreased transcription is involved in the specificity of methylated genes, it is likely that specific genes are methylated according to carcinogenic factors. These findings emphasize the usefulness of DNA methylation as a marker for past exposure to carcinogens and future risk of cancer development.},

abstract = {A central unresolved problem of evolutionary biology concerns the way in which evolution at the genotypic level relates to the evolution of phenotypes. This genotype-phenotype map involves developmental and physiological processes, which are complex and not well understood. These processes co-determine the rate and direction of adaptive change by shaping the distribution of phenotypic variability on which selection can act. In this study, we argue-expanding on earlier ideas by Goodwin, Oster, and Alberch-that an explicit treatment of this map in terms of dynamical systems theory can provide an integrated understanding of evolution and development. We describe a conceptual framework, which demonstrates how development determines the probability of possible phenotypic transitions-and hence the evolvability of a biological system. We use a simple conceptual model to illustrate how the regulatory dynamics of the genotype-phenotype map can be passed on from generation to generation, and how heredity itself can be treated as a dynamic process. Our model yields explanations for punctuated evolutionary dynamics, the difference between micro- and macroevolution, and for the role of the environment in major phenotypic transitions. We propose a quantitative research program in evolutionary developmental systems biology-combining experimental methods with mathematical modeling-which aims at elaborating our conceptual framework by applying it to a wide range of evolving developmental systems. This requires a large and sustained effort, which we believe is justified by the significant potential benefits of an extended evolutionary theory that uses dynamic molecular genetic data to reintegrate development and evolution.

abstract = {It is believed that the 3-dimensional organization of centromeric heterochromatin in interphase may be of functional relevance as an epigenetic mechanism for the regulation of gene expression. Accordingly, a likely possibility is that the centromeres that spatially associate into the heterochromatic structures (chromocenters) observed in the G1 phase of the cell cycle will differ in different cells. We sought to address this issue using, as a model, the chromocenters observed in quiescent normal human hematopoietic cells and primary fibroblasts. To do this, we analyzed the spatial relationships among different human centromeres in 3-D preserved cells using nonisotopic in situ hybridization and confocal microscopy. We showed quantitatively that chromocenters in all cell types do indeed represent nonrandom spatial associations of certain centromeres. Furthermore, the observed patterns of centromere association indicate that the chromocenters in these cell types are made of different combinations of specific centromeres, that hematopoietic cells are strikingly different from fibroblasts as to the composition of their chromocenters and that centromeres in peripheral blood cells appear to aggregate into distinct "myeloid" (present in monocytes and granulocytes) and "lymphoid" (present in lymphocytes) spatial patterns. These findings support the idea that the chromocenters formed in the nucleus of quiescent hematopoietic cells might represent heterochromatic nuclear compartments involved in the regulation of cell-type-specific gene expression, further suggesting that the spatial arrangement of centromeric heterochromatin in interphase is ontogenically determined during hematopoietic differentiation.

abstract = {Gene function in cancer can be disrupted either through genetic alterations, which directly mutate or delete genes, or epigenetic alterations, which alter the heritable state of gene expression. The latter events are mediated by formation of transcriptionally repressive chromatin states around gene transcription start sites and an associated gain of methylation in normally unmethylated CpG islands in these regions. The genes affected include over half of the tumor suppressor genes that cause familial cancers when mutated in the germline; the selective advantage for genetic and epigenetic dysfunction in these genes is very similar. The aberrant methylation can begin very early in tumor progression and mediate most of the important pathway abnormalities in cancer including loss of cell cycle control, altered function of transcription factors, altered receptor function, disruption of normal cell-cell and cell-substratum interaction, inactivation of signal transduction pathways, loss of apoptotic signals and genetic instability. The active role of the aberrant methylation in transcriptional silencing of genes is becoming increasingly understood and involves a synergy between the methylation and histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity. This synergy can be mediated directly by HDAC interaction with DNA methylating enzymes and by recruitment through complexes involving methyl-cytosine binding proteins. In the translational arena, the promoter hypermethylation changes hold great promise as DNA tumor markers and their potentially reversible state creates a target for cancer therapeutic strategies involving gene reactivation.},

abstract = {The mechanisms by which embryonic stem (ES) cells self-renew while maintaining the ability to differentiate into virtually all adult cell types are not well understood. Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are transcriptional repressors that help to maintain cellular identity during metazoan development by epigenetic modification of chromatin structure. PcG proteins have essential roles in early embryonic development and have been implicated in ES cell pluripotency, but few of their target genes are known in mammals. Here we show that PcG proteins directly repress a large cohort of developmental regulators in murine ES cells, the expression of which would otherwise promote differentiation. Using genome-wide location analysis in murine ES cells, we found that the Polycomb repressive complexes PRC1 and PRC2 co-occupied 512 genes, many of which encode transcription factors with important roles in development. All of the co-occupied genes contained modified nucleosomes (trimethylated Lys 27 on histone H3). Consistent with a causal role in gene silencing in ES cells, PcG target genes were de-repressed in cells deficient for the PRC2 component Eed, and were preferentially activated on induction of differentiation. Our results indicate that dynamic repression of developmental pathways by Polycomb complexes may be required for maintaining ES cell pluripotency and plasticity during embryonic development.},

abstract = {Studies have shown that DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) is the principal enzyme responsible for maintaining CpG methylation and is required for embryonic development and survival of somatic cells in mice. The role of DNMT1 in human cancer cells, however, remains highly controversial. Using homologous recombination, here we have generated a DNMT1 conditional allele in the human colorectal carcinoma cell line HCT116 in which several exons encoding the catalytic domain are flanked by loxP sites. Cre recombinase-mediated disruption of this allele results in hemimethylation of approximately 20\% of CpG-CpG dyads in the genome, coupled with activation of the G2/M checkpoint, leading to arrest in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. Although cells gradually escape from this arrest, they show severe mitotic defects and undergo cell death either during mitosis or after arresting in a tetraploid G1 state. Our results thus show that DNMT1 is required for faithfully maintaining DNA methylation patterns in human cancer cells and is essential for their proliferation and survival.},

abstract = {Bilaterian animals have a Hox gene cluster essential for patterning the main body axis, and a ParaHox gene cluster. Comparison of Hox and ParaHox genes has led workers to postulate that both clusters originated from the duplication of an ancient cluster named ProtoHox, which contained up to four genes with at least the precursors of anterior and posterior Hox/ParaHox genes. However, the way in which genes diversified within the ProtoHox, Hox and ParaHox clusters remains unclear because no systematic study of non-bilaterian animals exists. Here we characterize the full Hox/ParaHox gene complements and genomic organization in two cnidarian species (Nematostella vectensis and Hydra magnipapillata), and suggest a ProtoHox cluster simpler than originally thought on the basis of three arguments. First, both species possess bilaterian-like anterior Hox genes, but their non-anterior genes do not appear as counterparts of either bilaterian central or posterior genes; second, two clustered ParaHox genes, Gsx and a gene related to Xlox and Cdx, are found in Nematostella vectensis; and third, we do not find clear phylogenetic support for a common origin of bilaterian Cdx and posterior genes, which might therefore have appeared after the ProtoHox cluster duplication. Consequently, the ProtoHox cluster might have consisted of only two anterior genes. Non-anterior genes could have appeared independently in the Hox and ParaHox clusters, possibly after the separation of bilaterians and cnidarians.},

This intricate defence system consists of many molecules, mechanisms and tissues that are not present in jawless vertebrates. Two macroevolutionary events are believed to have contributed to the genesis of the AIS: the emergence of the recombination-activating gene (RAG) transposon, and two rounds of whole-genome duplication. It has recently been discovered that a non-RAG-based AIS with similarities to the jawed vertebrate AIS - including two lymphoid cell lineages - arose in jawless fish by convergent evolution. We offer insights into the latest advances in this field and speculate on the selective pressures that led to the emergence and maintenance of the AIS.},

abstract = {We investigated the early development of the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis, an emerging model system of the Cnidaria. Early cleavage stages are characterized by substantial variability from embryo to embryo, yet invariably lead to the formation of a coeloblastula. The coeloblastula undergoes a series of unusual broad invaginations-evaginations which can be blocked by cell cycle inhibitors suggesting a causal link of the invagination cycles to the synchronized cell divisions. Blastula invagination cycles stop as cell divisions become asynchronous. Marking experiments show a clear correspondence of the animal-vegetal axis of the egg to the oral-aboral axis of the embryo. The animal pole gives rise to the concave side of the blastula and later to the blastopore of the gastrula, and hence the oral pole of the future polyp. Asymmetric distribution of granules in the unfertilized egg suggest an animal-vegetal asymmetry in the egg in addition to the localized position of the pronucleus. To determine whether this asymmetry reflects asymmetrically distributed determinants along the animal-vegetal axis, we carried out blastomere isolations and embryonic divisions at various stages. Our data strongly indicate that normal primary polyps develop only if cellular material from the animal hemisphere is included, whereas the vegetal hemisphere alone is incapable to differentiate an oral pole. Molecular marker analysis suggests that also the correct patterning of the aboral pole depends on signals from the oral half. This suggests that in Nematostella embryos the animal hemisphere contains organizing activity to form a normal polyp.},

abstract = {The histone acetyltransferase coactivators CBP (CREBBP) and p300 (EP300) have more than 400 described protein interaction partners and are implicated in numerous transcriptional pathways. We have shown previously that CBP and p300 double knockout mutations in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (dKO MEFs) result in mixed effects on cAMP-inducible gene expression, with many CREB target genes requiring CBP/p300 for full expression, while others are unaffected or expressed better in their absence. Here we used CBP and p300 dKO MEFs to examine gene expression in response to four other signals: DNA damage (via p53), double-stranded RNA, serum, and retinoic acid. We found that while retinoic acid-inducible gene expression tends to be uniformly dependent on CBP/p300, dsRNA- and serum-inducible genes displayed non-uniform requirements for CBP/p300, with the dsRNA-inducible expression of Ifnb1 (interferon-$\beta$) being particularly dependent on CBP/p300. Surprisingly, the p53-dependent genes Cdkn1a (p21/CIP/WAF) and Mdm2 did not require CBP/p300 for their expression. As with cAMP-responsive CREB targets, we propose that the signal-responsive recruitment of CBP and p300 does not necessarily indicate a requirement for these coactivators at a locus. Rather, target gene context (e.g. DNA sequence) influences the extent to which transcription requires CBP/p300 versus other coactivators, which may not be HATs.},

Unraveling transcription regulatory networks and their malfunctions such as cancer became feasible due to recent stellar progress in experimental techniques and computational analyses. While predictions of isolated sites still pose notorious challenges, cis-regulatory modules (clusters) of binding sites can now be identified with high accuracy. Further support comes from conserved DNA segments, co-regulation, transposable elements, nucleosomes, and three-dimensional chromosomal structures. We introduce computational tools for the analysis and interpretation of chromatin immunoprecipitation, next-generation sequencing, SELEX, and protein-binding microarray results. Because immunoprecipitation produces overly large DNA segments and well over half of the sequencing reads from constitute background noise, methods are presented for background correction, sequence read mapping, peak calling, false discovery rate estimation, and co-localization analyses. To discover short binding site motifs from extensive immunoprecipitation segments, we recommend algorithms and software based on expectation maximization and Gibbs sampling. Data integration using several databases further improves performance. Binding sites can be visualized in genomic and chromatin context using genome browsers. Binding site information, integrated with co-expression in large compendia of gene expression experiments, allows us to reveal complex transcriptional regulatory networks.},

abstract = {Despite the important role of Polycomb in genome-wide silencing, little is known of the specific biochemical mechanism by which it inactivates transcription. Here we address how recombinant Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) inhibits activated RNA polymerase II preinitiation complex (PIC) assembly using immobilized H3K27-methylated chromatin templates in vitro. Recombinant PRC1 inhibited transcription, but had little effect on binding of the activator as reported previously. In contrast, Mediator and the general transcription factors were blocked during assembly or dissociated from preassembled PICs. Importantly, among the PIC components, Tata Binding Protein (TBP) was the most resistant to eviction by PRC1. Immobilized template experiments using purified PRC1, transcription factor II D (TFIID), and Mediator indicate that PRC1 blocks the recruitment of Mediator, but not TFIID. We conclude that PRC1 functions to block or dissociate PICs by interfering with Mediator, but leaves TBP and perhaps TFIID intact, highlighting a specific mechanism for PRC1 transcriptional silencing. Analysis of published genome-wide datasets from mouse embryonic stem cells revealed that the Ring1b subunit of PRC1 and TBP co-enrich at developmental genes. Further, genes enriched for Ring1b and TBP are expressed at significantly lower levels than those enriched for Mediator, TBP, and Ring1b. Collectively, the data are consistent with a model in which PRC1 and TFIID could co-occupy genes poised for activation during development.},

Methylation and the relationship between methylation and cancer have been the focus of molecular biology researches. Methylation represses gene expression and can influence embryogenesis and tumorigenesis. In different tissues and at different stages of life, the level of methylation of DNA varies, implying a fundamental but distinct role for methylation. When genes are repressed by abnormal methylation, the resulting effects can include instability of that gene and inactivation of a tumor suppressor gene. MicroRNAs have some aspects in common with this regulation of gene expression. Here we reviewed the influence of gene methylation on cancer and analyzed the methods used to profile methylation. We also assessed the correlation between methylation and other epigenetic modifications and microRNAs. About 55,845 research papers have been published about methylation, and one-fifth of these are about the appearance of methylation in cancer. We conclude that methylation does play a role in some cancer types.},

abstract = {Gastrulation is a central event in metazoan development, involving many cellular behaviors including invagination, delamination, and ingression. Understanding the cell biology underlying gastrulation in many different taxa will help clarify the evolution of gastrulation mechanisms. Gastrulation in the anthozoan cnidarian Nematostella vectensis has been described as a combination of invagination and unipolar ingression through epithelial to mesenchymal transitions (EMT), possibly controlled by snail genes, important regulators of EMT in other organisms. Our examination, however, fails to reveal evidence of ingressing cells. Rather, we observe that endodermal cells constrict their apices, adopting bottle-like morphologies especially pronounced adjacent to the blastopore lip. They retain apical projections extending to the archenteron throughout gastrulation. Basally, they form actin-rich protrusions, including interdigitating filopodia that may be important in pulling the ectodermal and endodermal cells together. Endodermal cells retain cell-cell junctions while invaginating, and are organized throughout development. Never is the blastocoel filled by a mass of mesenchyme. Additionally, injection of splice-blocking morpholinos to Nematostella snail genes does not result in a phenotype despite dramatically reducing wild-type transcript, and overexpression of Snail-GFP in different clonal domains has no effect on cell behavior. These data indicate that EMT is not a major factor during gastrulation in Nematostella.},

abstract = {Notch signaling is among the oldest of known Metazoan signaling pathways and is used in a multitude of developmental contexts to effect cellular differentiation, specification and the maintenance of stem cell state. Here we report the isolation and expression of the canonical Notch signaling pathway in the early branching metazoan Nematostella vectensis (Anthozoa, Cnidaria) during embryonic and larval development. We have used pharmacological treatment, morpholino knockdown, and dominant negative misexpression experiments to demonstrate that Notch signaling acts to mediate cnidogenesis, the development of cnidarian-specific neural effecter cells. Notch signaling often results in the transcriptional activation of NvHes genes, a conserved family of bHLH transcription factors. A loss of Notch signaling through use of pharmacological inhibition or knock-down of the Notch effecter gene Suppressor of Hairless Su(H) similarly results in a loss of cnidocyte cell fate. We also provide evidence that Notch signaling is responsible for certain aspects of neurogenesis in developing N. vectensis planula in which disruption of Notch cleavage via the pharmacological agent DAPT results in increased expression of neural marker genes in vivo. This data suggests that Notch signaling acting on components of the developing nervous system is an ancient role of this pathway. The shared requirement of Notch signaling for the development of both cnidocytes and neurons further supports the hypothesis that cnidocytes and neurons share common origins as multifunctional sensory-effecter cells.},

abstract = {Systematic annotation of gene regulatory elements is a major challenge in genome science. Direct mapping of chromatin modification marks and transcriptional factor binding sites genome-wide has successfully identified specific subtypes of regulatory elements. In Drosophila several pioneering studies have provided genome-wide identification of Polycomb response elements, chromatin states, transcription factor binding sites, RNA polymerase II regulation and insulator elements; however, comprehensive annotation of the regulatory genome remains a significant challenge. Here we describe results from the modENCODE cis-regulatory annotation project. We produced a map of the Drosophila melanogaster regulatory genome on the basis of more than 300 chromatin immunoprecipitation data sets for eight chromatin features, five histone deacetylases and thirty-eight site-specific transcription factors at different stages of development. Using these data we inferred more than 20,000 candidate regulatory elements and validated a subset of predictions for promoters, enhancers and insulators in vivo. We identified also nearly 2,000 genomic regions of dense transcription factor binding associated with chromatin activity and accessibility. We discovered hundreds of new transcription factor co-binding relationships and defined a transcription factor network with over 800 potential regulatory relationships.},

abstract = {Noncoding RNAs are important components of regulatory networks controlling the epigenetic state of chromatin. We analyzed the role of pRNA (promoter-associated RNA), a noncoding RNA that is complementary to the rDNA promoter, in mediating de novo CpG methylation of rRNA genes (rDNA). We show that pRNA interacts with the target site of the transcription factor TTF-I, forming a DNA:RNA triplex that is specifically recognized by the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3b. The results reveal a compelling new mechanism of RNA-dependent DNA methylation, suggesting that recruitment of DNMT3b by DNA:RNA triplexes may be a common and generally used pathway in epigenetic regulation.},

abstract = {Mammalian histone variant H3.3 differs from replication-dependent histone H3.1 by five amino acids, including replacement of alanine 31 by serine. H3.3 is expressed throughout the cell cycle, primarily deposited at transcriptionally active loci independent of S-phase. Data from mammalian cells suggest that phosphorylation of serine 31 (H3.3S31P) plays a role in mitosis. Here we show that H3.3S31P also occurs during mitosis of the urochordate Oikopleura dioica, suggesting this histone modification and its function in mitosis is already present at the invertebrate-vertebrate transition. The spatial pattern differed from that of H3 phosphorylation at serine 28 (H3S28P). H3S28P was enriched near telomeric regions, but H3.3S31P differed both temporally and spatially from the mammalian pattern, being more widely distributed throughout prophase, prometaphase and metaphase chromosomes. We also identified an important role for H3.3S31P during oogenic meiosis in the semelparous O. dioica. H3.3S31P initiated together with H3S28P in all meiotic nuclei in late diplotene, after H3S10P. However, H3.3S31P was retained only on the subset of meiotic nuclei that seeded maturing oocytes and proceeded through meiosis to arrest in metaphase I. Thus, this epigenetic mark is part of a regulatory circuitry that enables O. dioica to numerically adjust oocyte production over two orders of magnitude.},

A diverse array of post-translational modifications that often occur on tail domains of these proteins has been well documented. Although the function of these highly conserved modifications has remained elusive, converging biochemical and genetic evidence suggests functions in several chromatin-based processes. We propose that distinct histone modifications, on one or more tails, act sequentially or in combination to form a 'histone code' that is, read by other proteins to bring about distinct downstream events.},

@article{Wang2011,
abstract = {Boundary elements partition eukaryotic chromatin into active and repressive domains, and can also block regulatory interactions between domains. Boundary elements act via diverse mechanisms making accurate feature-based computational predictions difficult. Therefore, we developed an unbiased algorithm that predicts the locations of human boundary elements based on the genomic distributions of chromatin and transcriptional states, as opposed to any intrinsic characteristics that they may possess. Application of our algorithm to ChIP-seq data for histone modifications and RNA Pol II-binding data in human CD4+ T cells resulted in the prediction of 2542 putative chromatin boundary elements genome wide. Predicted boundary elements display two distinct features: first, position-specific open chromatin and histone acetylation that is coincident with the recruitment of sequence-specific DNA-binding factors such as CTCF, EVI1 and YYI, and second, a directional and gradual increase in histone lysine methylation across predicted boundaries coincident with a gain of expression of non-coding RNAs, including examples of boundaries encoded by tRNA and other non-coding RNA genes. Accordingly, a number of the predicted human boundaries may function via the synergistic action of sequence-specific recruitment of transcription factors leading to non-coding RNA transcriptional interference and the blocking of facultative heterochromatin propagation by transcription-associated chromatin remodeling complexes.},

The historical aspects that we cover will be helpful in interpreting this literature and we hope that our discussion of the newest analytical methods will stimulate future progress. We emphasize that no single approach can provide a complete view of the overall methylome, and that combinations of several modalities applied to the same sample set will give the clearest picture. Given the unexpected epigenomic patterns and new biological principles, as well as new disease markers, that have been uncovered in recent studies, it is likely that important discoveries will continue to be made using genome-wide DNA methylation profiling.},
